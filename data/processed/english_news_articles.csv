Fed Up,2016-11-04T19:40:00.000+02:00,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

after comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control 
elite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton 
certainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week 
note despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell 
see also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice 
the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state 
zero hedge adds 
now it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over 
here is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey 
watch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server

fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

Shawn Helton,2016-10-29T04:22:00.000+03:00,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire

while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid 
anointed chelsea clinton with goldman sachsbacked hedge funder marc mezvinsky 
the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses  
continuing politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from ed mezvinskys wife to then president bill clinton 
records released last week by the clinton presidential library in little rock and obtained by politico show mezvinsky and his thenwife  exrep marjorie margoliesmezvinsky dpa  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case 
in  the daily mail reported the following chelsea clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the greek economy and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds marc mezvinsky  and his partners former goldman sachs colleagues bennett grau and mark mallon raised million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation that fund however has lost  percent of its value investors with direct knowledge of the situation told the new york times  and will now be closed

the ny times further outlined the longheld clintongoldman connection just two years before the  financial crisis the clintons relationships with wall street deepened in the s when mr clinton set up his foundation in harlem and mrs clinton was elected to the senate from new york that brought her in close touch with the big wall street firms a source of jobs and tax revenue for new york  and a leading source of campaign funds for mrs clinton during her years in congress employees of goldman donated in excess of  to mrs clinton more than those of any other company except citigroup according to the center for responsive politics along with other new york politicians mrs clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate lower manhattan after the sept   attacks and those breaks helped goldman build its new roughly  billion headquarters when it broke ground in  mrs clinton and other new york officials were onsite how to monetize influence lloyd blankfein at a clinton global initiative event with hillary clinton image source sputniknews  the wall street racket to understand who powers the clinton foundations billion dollar rico influencepeddling slush fund you need to understand how money is laundered between wall street and washington dc goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bank of america and citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the  crash then in april of  goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for  billion dollars cnbc reported the following 
goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and

wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

Shawn Helton,2016-11-04T00:03:00.000+02:00,partners in crime goldman sachs the clintons  wall street,"st century wire says 
this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation 
ja yes

No Author,2016-11-04T15:33:00.000+02:00,wikileaks hillary clinton knew saudi qatar were funding isis  but still took their money for foundation,"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

over the past months hillary clinton the obama white house and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  russia is hacking the us election  blaming moscow for the wikileaks emails the dnc leaks and for allegedly hacking us voting systems despite the grand accusations no evidence or proof has been offered by the us government 
it goes without saying how damaging the democratic partys crazed witch hunt has been to usrussian relations where clinton has led the antirussian crusade and demonizing president vladimir putin at every opportunity 
todays stunning presidential victory by donald trump means that all eyes are now on putin to see how moscow and washington will be interfacing going forward 
with such sensitive geopolitical issues like syria and the ukraine currently in play what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward 
in a message to donald trump russian president vladimir putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between moscow and washington in keeping with each others views meets the interests of both russia and the us 
putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing russianamerican relations out of their current crisis 
the russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security ria novosti reported 
on top of it putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between moscow and washington based on principles of equality mutual respect and each others positions meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community 
according to many observers usrussia relations are now at their lowest point since the cold war putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of russias relations with the us was not our choice however 
for things to improve between moscow and washington the us should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect russias interests rather than try to dictate terms putin said last month 
we are concerned with the deterioration of russianamerican relations but that was not our choice we never wanted that on the contrary we want to have friendly relations with the us a great country and a leading economy putin said at an economic forum in moscow

shawn helton st century wire 
antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama 
outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton 
the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

we have seen soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries most recently in ukraine with the soros sponsored maidan coup 
now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency 
we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests 
we are certain trumps victory is a bitter pill for globalist soros to swallow between putin and trump soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter

if trump wins expect the likes of soros and moveonorg to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs who will protest riot smash and burn their way on to cnns  hour news rotation expect occupy  and blacklivesmatter to rage 
on friday henningsen talked to rt international about the postelections protests that were coordinated in part by democratic party community organizing online platform moveonorg  watch 
 not surprisingly moveonorg have also launched a national activist campaign to  abolish the electoral college  after democratic candidate hillary clinton came up short with  including new hampshire to donald trumps  including arizona and michigan final totals are not yet in but thus far  would be the fifth time in us history that a presidential candidate has won the white house while losing the total popular vote

wire associate editor shawn helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in cia and sorosfunded color revolutions overseas  are now being deployed on us domestic shores by similar ngo front organizations has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of donald trump 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests says helton 
helton also raised the question as to why president obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests opting instead to lead from behind he explains 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency

the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect donald trump is in full swing 
between all of the fake polling intentionally proclinton partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left 
its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes 
cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off 
when told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it 
one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes 
now its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets 
in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump and to help stoke more nationwide protests 
buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  
a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a donald trump hat made up the story police said in a statement 
the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported 
lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported 
during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read 
note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media 
thats right  this was just another hoax 
violent democraticaffiliated street gangs 
what leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters 
here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo 
 mama angel mommysaurus november   
watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a trump supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip 
 here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital 
from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama 
these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency 
amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage 
what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  
one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary clinton candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it 
now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage 
none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years

lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains

the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

if there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class those doubts can finally be put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing 
the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it 
eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy 
no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer 
the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt 
the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology 
we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international 
 rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda 
the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote 
putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues 
 the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said 
adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work 
in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining 
written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  
the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc 
at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  
the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly isisisil 
the report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values  
it called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat by means of  investing in awareness raising education online and local media  it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication  
sputnik has already appealed to the un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos including reporters without borders to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu 
 the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media including sputnik agency and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu moreover the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms reads the letter signed by sputnik editorinchief margarita simonyan 
during the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter

No Author,2016-11-25T02:49:00.000+02:00,eu red scare brussels passes new resolution to counter russian media propaganda," share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system 
columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than  million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than  million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november 
the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about  amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee 
the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid her campaign logo has always symbolized americas quest to move forward with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right lefthanded people of course dispute that symbolism because for them moving forward should be pointing to the left 
but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left 
the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate 
the gops presumptive nominee donald trump is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist which would give clinton the edge among conservative voters

how i wish it were the dodgers who took the field tuesday night in cleveland yes were all sad in los angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the th anniversary of its last world series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride 
the dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot chief wahoo just in time for the playoffs 
for those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary the cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced chief wahoo on its caps with a vintage red c it never officially retired the offending mascot but wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the nfls washington redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postindians era 
or so we thought chief wahoo reappeared when the cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the boston red sox and he hasnt left he remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the toronto blue jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term indians while the team was on canadian soil 
snip 
its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as cleveland the cubs championship drought has famously lasted for  baseball seasons but the cleveland team boasts a pitiable  years without a world series title beyond sports clevelands decline as an important american metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of plus in  to less than  today snip 
but cleveland hey i know some generous wonderfully caring people from that part of ohio which makes wishing for their teams brutal defeat personally difficult but being on the right side of a moral dispute isnt supposed to be easy especially when the team in question isnt the evil washington redskins and its infernal owner daniel snyder clevelands municipal misery doesnt excuse the disgraceful exalting of chief wahoo any more than white mens economic hardship makes donald trumps popularity ok

a group of asian american students is planning to protest the harvardradcliffe gilbert and sullivan players upcoming production of the mikado for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera 
organized by george s qiao  the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the japanese stereotypes and appropriation of japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted productions storyline but later qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the players 
i fully believe that members of the gilbert and sullivan players put their blood sweat and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production qiao said however i believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement with this plays history of japanese cultural misrepresentation 
penned in  the mikado is a comical opera set in the fictional japanese town of titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of british political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated asian names and stereotypical cultural caricatures 
snip hoping to avoid these issues in their own production the board of the gilbert and sullivan players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera characterizing their rendition as a reimagining of the original production 
the board of the harvardradcliffe gilbert  sullivan players whose mission is to produce the full canon of gilbert and sullivans shows faced a dilemma this past january kathleen c zhou  the president of the players wrote in an oped for the crimson tuesday strike the mikado from our season and ignore one of the most problematic but wellknown gs shows or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent 
the setting of their show is no longer the th century town of titipu and instead is now th century las vegas themed oriental hotel and the opening number gentlemen of japan has been rewritten as gentlemen of the strip 
snip 
zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical operas script the complete omission of all of the original productions issues was an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to asians

imagine if during the jim crow era a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers 
thats basically what facebook is doing nowadays 
the ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls ethnic affinities ads that exclude people based on race gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment 
snip 
the ad we purchased was targeted to facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an affinity for africanamerican asianamerican or hispanic people  heres the ad itself  
when we showed facebooks racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer john relman  he gasped and said this is horrifying this is massively illegal this is about as blatant a violation of the federal fair housing act as one can find 
the fair housing act of  makes it illegal to make print or publish or cause to be made printed or published any notice statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference limitation or discrimination based on race color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines

satterfield added that the ethnic affinity is not the same as racewhich facebook does not ask its members about facebook assigns members an ethnic affinity based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on facebook 
when we asked why ethnic affinity was included in the demographics category of its adtargeting tool if its not a representation of demographics facebook responded that it plans to move ethnic affinity to another section

Henry Wolff,2016-10-28T06:29:00.000+03:00,chinese immigrants demand protection from paris muggers,"posted on october   media selfdestruct over trump jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired 
from the start of donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house 
the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan 
media dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump   top racists and neonazis back donald trump   heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support donald trump  
these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too 
this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton  no one suggested this meant she was a communist 
it is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it  david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question 
that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  
tapper  will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election 
donald trump  well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists 
the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one 
there are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that 
second donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness 
the press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign 
now the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants 
i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump 
i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about 
i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas 
what donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign 
i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to 
the whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways 
i am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us 
maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall 
there is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries 
and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone 
dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news 
despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity 
whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never

kansas state rep joe seiwert commented on facebook that an africanamerican singer who knelt while performing the star spangled banner at a miami heat game should go back to where she claims as home 
seiwert rpretty prairie posted that comment and a longer followup on an antiblack meme that was originally posted to a prodonald trump facebook group and then shared by one of seiwerts constituents 
seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his first amendment right to free speech as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a black lives matter tshirt and knelt while singing the anthem 
snip 
the photo in the meme is of denasia lawrence a miami social worker and according to the miami sunsentinel a parttime gamenight employee of the heat professional basketball team the team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at fridays preseason game with the philadelphia ers 
snip 
to which seiwert responded i am where i claim home and like it they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like so if they dont like it here i believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if thats what they believe 
seiwert said he didnt see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didnt do anything wrong 
i have a personal life besides a legislative life he said maybe it was inappropriate i dont believe so because i said nothing derogatory and i believe that if people are that upset with the national anthem they can do whatever they want to on their own time but when theyre using it on national tv to make a statement thats not right 
i said if she lawrence doesnt like it here then go where she would like it whats wrong with that he said 
asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are seiwert responded because maybe theres other people who dont want their place changed 
he also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race 
it dont make any difference if theyre black white or green its the disrespect to our country he said and why does everybody put the color to it

to many donald trumps pledge to build a wall along the usmexico border is unrealistic but for jim chilton its the only way hell get a good nights sleep 
the yearold a fifthgeneration rancher on the arizona border with mexico says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglersrather than just cattleon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles 
i really admire trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know whats wrong with the current border system he said as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his squaremile ranch that stretches to the mexican border 
we need a wall ive been saying that for  years    and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in he added it would make my life so much better and id feel more secure

chilton who admits that trump was not his first choice among the republican candidates for the white house says building a barrier to secure the mile kilometer usmexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security 
snip 
i live in a nomans land i live in a land that is occupied by the sinaloa drug cartel he sighed pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers 
i have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before    and even in my front yard he said i wave at them and they often yell hola and wave back 
chiltonwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedsideadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like islamic state is may be using them to slip operatives into the united states 
snip 
but beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism chilton insists that trumps wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons 
its just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch its outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and its outrageous for my cowboys he said referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the us through the brutal desert 
this is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue

defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

snip according to misao dean professor of english at the university of victoria the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism imperialism and genocide due to history she also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society 
in a radio interview for cbc radio  which wasnt picked up by the internet until several months later she claimed we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol something that seems natural that seems ordinary and seems to promote values that we ascribe to 
but i think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrativeand that narrative is about to be blunt its about theft and genocide the professor said 
snip 
its not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age    certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society theyre frequently highly educated people theyre almost completely white she said 
cbc radio host jim brown then asked a question should we look at the canoe as a noncontroversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism 
to which the academic replied absolutely a symbol of colonialism it seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the canadian government and canadians in general did to first nations people

Henry Wolff,2016-10-29T04:39:11.311+03:00,more migrants pitch tents on paris streets as calais camp shuts,"amanda taub new york times november   
call it the crisis of whiteness 
white anxiety has fueled this years political tumult in the west britains surprising vote to exit the european union donald j trumps unexpected capture of the republican presidential nomination in the united states the rise of rightwing nationalism in norway hungary austria and greece 
whiteness in this context is more than just skin color you could define it as membership in the ethnonational majority but thats a mouthful what it really means is the privilege of not being defined as other 
whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance traditions religion and even food are the default norm its being a person who by unspoken rules was long entitled as part of us instead of them 
snip 
its fundamentally about who are we said eric kaufmann a professor of politics at birkbeck college university of london what does it mean to be part of this nation is it not our nation anymore our meaning the ethnic majority 
these kinds of questions are really front and center even though theyre not necessarily verbalized 
the questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism through the civil rights movement in the united states and the european unions opening up of borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in say university admissions but rising wages an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents and confident that their children would do better still 
that feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself 
but as western manufacturing and industry have declined taking many workingclass towns with them parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation 
that creates an identity vacuum to be filled 
for someone who is lower income or lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going to get more selfesteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity 
snip 
a recent gallup study found that mr trumps supporters tend to earn aboveaverage incomes for their communities but also tend to live in majoritywhite areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents 
snip 
the formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has by extension constructed a new broader national identity the united states has a black president london has a muslim mayor of pakistani descent 
but that broadening can to some feel like a painful loss articulated in the demand voiced over and over at trump rallies probrexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout europe i want my country back 
the mantra is not all about bigotry rather being part of a culture designed around peoples own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance of belonging 
the loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that robin diangelo a lecturer and author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default that whiteness is just a race like any other 
fragility leads to feelings of insecurity defensiveness even threat and it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders 
snip 
for decades the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy when that became taboo it left white identity politics without a vocabulary 
if you are a workingclass white person and you fear that the new cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis 
some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns trade crime the war on drugs controlling the borders fear of islamist terrorism all are significant in their own right and create very real fears for many people but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what societys changes mean for white majorities

when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence her research took her to farflung places like kenya and burma 
lately shes been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states 
the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trumps rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it she has examined electionyear speech before but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great 
but in the past week with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups she said 
benesch  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience 
trumps speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it benesch said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous 
but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said 
and now with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience 
because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech 
trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy benesch said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward

for president obama uncontrolled migration into europe is a major national security issue for the united states even the dalai lama agrees that there are too many refugees inside the european union 
really too many historic consider these facts more than  million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in  according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr  including  million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries 
admittedly a record  million refugees sought asylum within the european union last year with thousands more applying for asylum every month yet what of subsaharan africa home to  million refugees and a whopping  million people of concern to the un high commissioner for refugees 
we dont often hear about these particular refugees or asylumseekers do we they are to borrow a term from british historian mark curtis unpeople the poor nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the western media 
where is the rolling coverage of kenyas dadaab camp for example dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world but in a move that could displace as many as  people  kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down it puts the recent british media frenzy over the socalled jungle camp in calais france with its  migrants into some perspective doesnt it

vladimir putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning europes handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in austria dilutes national values 
the russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that cant protect its children has no future 
his comments come off the back of a case in austria last week which saw an iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a yearold boy at a swimming pool in vienna overturned 
he was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didnt prove he realised the boy was saying no 
it came after the migrant identified as yearold amir a claimed that it was a sexual emergency because he had not had sex for four months 
a second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then 
and speaking at a press conference this week putin slammed europes migration policy and cited the case where the victim was from a serbian family living in austria 
he said in a european country a child is raped by a migrant and the court releases him 
it doesnt fit into my head what on earth theyre thinking over there 
i cant even explain the rationaleis it a sense of guilt before the migrants whats going on its not clear 
he also claimed that the case highlighted the dissolution of traditional national values adding a society that cannot defend its children has no future 
and putins words appeared to have struck a chord as he is extremely popular with serbs 
in the rape case the boy had arrived in austria with his serbian mother who paid for him to go to the theresienbad swimming pool where he was violently attacked 
the boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the iraqi mans second trial outraging the austrian serbian community 
austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers who were previously divided about whether to vote for the leftleaning green party candidate or the far right option nobert hofer in upcoming elections 
however it is not the first time russia has lashed out at the eus handling of the migrant crisis 
in march konstantin romodanovsky head of russias federal migration service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the continent 
he also added that multiculturalism has failed because europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into western society 
he said the european commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekersdespite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different

the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,harvard cancels mens soccer season finding sexually explicit

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working

AR Staff,2016-11-06T16:03:07.410+02:00,when the river ran red,"why obama will win jared taylor american renaissance august  
it is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the united states will be black why will a nation we are so often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference 
ever since hillary clinton dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack obama will beat john mccain the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama 
first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr obama 
second as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as jesse jackson or al sharpton but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black 
for many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials 
third young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did 
fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history 
the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains 
fifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like 
mr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators 
but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could 
the final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this 
many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe 
in any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white 
racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine 
some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate 
aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it 
president obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all 
even mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get 
on the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small mrs obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an american 
it will be an edifying presidency and whites may be a little less deluded in ",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,river ran red,obama win jared taylor

the first time dianna barindelli carried a baby that wasnt her own was in  we were done having kids but i still wanted to be pregnant says the modesto calif stayathome mom whose own daughters are  and  barindelli signed up with the center for surrogate parenting in encino one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world in  she matched with a chinese couple unlike many agencies csp first shows parent applications to the surrogates rather than the other way around its little things that youll connect with people over says barindelli who was attracted to pictures of the couples extended travels and their traditional wedding photos 
the embryo transfer took place in late  barindelli emailed the mom weekly sending updates and ultrasound pictures with wechat an app that offers instantaneous translation the intended parents ips planned to be there for the birth but the baby boy arrived two weeks early  hours before they arrived says barindelli i texted and made sure the mom was ok with him staying in my room i cleared everything with her i didnt want her to feel bad that she wasnt there 
barindelli who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls is pregnant again this time with the baby due feb  of a taiwanese couple she may not be done her first chinese couple emailed her recently soon after their sons first birthday they still have frozen embryos and hope that barindelli now  will carry their second child 
commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world as well as in many us states until recently infertile couples singles and gay wouldbe dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate among them india thailand nepal and mexico where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the  to  bill typical in the us but in the past few years those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy meanwhile chinathe worlds most populous country with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the uslifted its decadeslong onechild policy the result is a soaring chinese demand for us surrogacy services one that is flourishing particularly in california with its culturally friendly enclaves excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard ips as a babys legal parents even before birth if proper court documents are filed snip

with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment  be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan 
no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now 
the lucky dragon hotel  casino is billing itself as las vegas first asianthemed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec  with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai 
no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned 
the rosecolored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eightsided for good fortune and its hard to find a no  on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the ninestory hotel even skips a fourth floor 
this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said 
with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp 
weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in  macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry 
weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in  
weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau 
lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middleclass chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community 
let them fight over the  and let us fight over the remaining  said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines 
that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec  hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said 
already a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
meanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  
plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business 
its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times 
competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump 
las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board 
the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck 
the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon 
jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum 
food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others 
las vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club 
no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip 
the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety 
jacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said 
were trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said 
though lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times 
chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon 
jacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate 
the company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track 
lucky dragon isnt the first las vegas resort to target a specific demographic the hard rock hotel  casino and the palms casino resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the strip such as the mgm grand and the cosmopolitan 
lucky dragons early backers even considered building an lgbt resort before settling on their current strategy one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic chinese gambling experience

Henry Wolff,2016-11-08T05:20:41.889+02:00,why american surrogates are in demand for chinese families,"world wildlife falls by  in  years  
bbc news global wildlife populations have fallen by  since  a report says 
the living planet assessment by the zoological society of london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  
the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses 
human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines 
dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on 
we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act 
however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years 
the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife 
for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf 
this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world 
the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos 
any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study 
the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time 
some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture 
the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years 
this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  
dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others 
we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example 
it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing 
if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl 
the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade 
dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse 
but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates 
however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university 
stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news 
for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe 
when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean 
theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed 
but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world 
its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data 
were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline 
its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,american surrogates demand chinese families,world wildlife falls years bbc news global wildlife populations fallen since report says living planet assessment zoological society london zsl wwf suggests trend continues decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates figures suggest animals living lakes rivers wetlands suffering biggest losses human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution climate change contributed declines dr mike barrett head science policy wwf said pretty clear business usual see continued declines wildlife populations think weve reached point isnt really excuse let carry know causes know scale impact humans nature wildlife populations really us act however methodology report criticised image copyright carlos drews wwf image caption report looked data collected species vertebrates last years living planet report published every two years aims provide assessment state worlds wildlife freshwater species alone decline stands since dr mike barrett wwf analysis looked different species birds fish mammals amphibians reptiles total number vertebrate species world team collected data peerreviewed studies government statistics surveys collated conservation groups ngos species population data going back two time points show trends included study researchers analysed population sizes changed time information weighted take account groups animals great deal data many records arctic near arctic birds example little data tropical amphibians example report authors said make sure surplus information declines animals skew overall picture last report published estimated worlds wildlife populations halved last years assessment suggests trend continued since populations declined average dr barrett said groups animals fared worse others see particularly strong declines freshwater environment freshwater species alone decline stands since related way water used taken fresh water systems also fragmentation freshwater systems dam building example also highlighted species african elephants suffered huge declines recent years increase poaching sharks threatened overfishing pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse dr robin freeman zsl researchers conclude vertebrate populations declining average year warn nothing done wildlife populations could fall levels end decade dr robin freeman head zsls indicators assessments unit said thats assuming things continue expect pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse one things think important stats trends declines number animals wildlife populations extinctions large vanishing presents us opportunity something image copyright scott dickerson image caption still many gaps knowledge worlds vertebrates however living planet reports drawn criticisms numbers report sensible numbers sketchy stuart pimm duke university stuart pimm professor conservation ecology duke university united states said wildlife decline many gaps data boil population loss single figure numbers report sensible numbers sketchy told bbc news example look data comes surprisingly massively skewed towards western europe go elsewhere data become far fewer practice become much much sketchier almost nothing south america tropical africa much tropics period time trying mix stuff like hard know numbers mean theyre trying pull stuff blender spew single number flawed dr freeman said team taken best data possible around world completely true regions groups like tropical amphibians example lack data thats lack data confident method using best method present overall estimate population decline entirely possible species arent monitored effectively may much worse id surprised much better observed,1
No Author,2016-10-27T12:23:59.627+03:00,sex and the presidential city,"email 
it was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones 
for the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants 
responding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant dyakov the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs 
dyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote 
you are insulting this horse my dear fellow dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from dyakov 
so you seethis is a horse dyakov said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends 
throwing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters 
today reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse 
my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some babels multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering 
the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevbabel who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes 
ms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andré gide and andré malraux 
it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady 
as he travels around ukraine malaevbabel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me 
although i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town 
throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevbabel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad 
while in paris babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevbabel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character 
in  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young babel served in the red cavalry 
never seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins 
at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people 
it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria 
babel was a friend and protégé of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist 
david novack the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there 
in an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left 
babel represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he documented brutality against the ukrainians and the jews brutality brought on by both sides it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the most the jews and the ukrainians the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was again the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:01:11.700+03:00,clinton policy on syria would lead to ww iii trump,"clintons nofly zone over syria will lead to war with russia warning of jcs chairman general dunford october   at  am global research  october   the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation 
in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi 
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives 
i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace 
this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added 
at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone 
the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense 
under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed 
michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option 
according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region 
confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces 
according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit
since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington 
flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone 
the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything
senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing 
what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage 
secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything 
senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  
secretary carter well okay 
senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms 
secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me 
senator wicker im speaking about a  
secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing 
let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add 
general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president 
senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped 
general dunford all options  
senator wicker what do you think of that option sir 
general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make 

concluding remarks 
from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation 
it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  
consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country 
the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:13:31.635+03:00,dr duke and dr macdonald call for prosecution of hillary for treasonous support of isis,"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,Real,dr duke dr macdonald call prosecution hillary treasonous support isis,could steal election trump even announced winner next

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-11-03T21:10:52.388+02:00,after debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,"david brooks whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization immigration and feminism november   at  am by dr patrick slattery 
on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school 
brooks conclusion was even more breath taking 
and shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out and therefore as a result what happened was they were alienated they got super cynical because they really were being shafted and so they react in an angry way 
well thats not a shock given the last  or  years of american history and so for us going forward its to not reverse the dynamism of american society and the diversity its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it and so this doesnt happen again 
here he admits that whites got shafted that we are being ruined by diversity but the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again what is he concerned that hispanics might be jewed out of the america they inherit from whites 
the rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against donald trump with any luck on tuesday trump will be elected president and we can make begin the process of making america america again",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,Real,debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,david brooks whites voting gene pool ruined globalization immigration feminism november dr patrick slattery pbs news hour friday david brooks said white people voting gene pool wow wow david brooks wrote new york times column jewish woman came speech knowing jewish told speech description jews taken america acknowledged column indeed caseone jewish professors boasted jews earn like episcopalians vote like puerto ricans words voted gene pool course eventually bought republican party well gave gene pools vote choice blacks famously vote gene pool hispanics expected vote gene pool whites whites alone consider ethnic interests voting something brooks rest zio elite goyish lackey find deplorable basically less educated high schooleducated whites going trump doesnt matter guy collegeeducated going clinton sometimes get sense campaign barely matters people going gene pool whatever one depressing aspects race brooks said reasons whites besides collegeindoctrinated whites voting gene pool even interesting lot good things years really good america think globalization really good america think influx immigrants really good america feminism really good america lot people used society three good things lot high schooleducated white guys displaced david brooks growing whites make close american population doesnt really make sense say displacement bulk american population good america course specify high schooleducated white guys well blacks helped globalization immigration feminism employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc white women well maybe ever wanted first place blue hair nose rings tattoos raise cats instead babies guess never asked college educated white guys well used go harvard yale affirmative action blacks hispanics competition asians massive jewish nepotism white guy lucky get secondtier state school brooks conclusion even breath taking shame us paying attention helping therefore result happened alienated got super cynical really shafted react angry way well thats shock given last years american history us going forward reverse dynamism american society diversity pay attention people ruined doesnt happen admits whites got shafted ruined diversity weird thing line doesnt happen concerned hispanics might jewed america inherit whites rest appearance poetic rant donald trump luck tuesday trump elected president make begin process making america america,1

dr david duke offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society 
a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars 
in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom 
i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent 
human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself 
not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale 
much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural 
human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth 
we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind 
we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit 
for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence 
nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions 
we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society 
if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite 
it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this 
we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all 
instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony 
we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people 
and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states 
look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom 
a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord 
just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity 
every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings 
this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict 
in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  
they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide 
better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect 
it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts 
it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity 
we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity 
we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity 
as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity 
this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened 
but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals 
i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine 
i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself 
there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself 
but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all 
in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity 
nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony 
it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast 
group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents 
although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony 
and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots 
this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression 
autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric 
nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people 
even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning 
when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic 
they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity 
contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict 
how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity 
so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values 
and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities 
there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants 
but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population 
this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority 
a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics 
the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit 
it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism 
the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth 
they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills 
they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt 
they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation 
and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people 
they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism 
globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence 
but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism 
we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence 
we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda 
we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars 
we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite 
we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity 
we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity 
whether we are kurds or pakistanis or iranians or palestinians whether we are chinese or japanese or africans or indians or of european heritage we say no to globalism 
we say yes to human freedom and global diversity we say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny 
we say no to the global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power we say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth 
we are humanity we are many 
because we honor our own heritage and traditions we honor every heritage and tradition 
because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on earth 
because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s 
just as most europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures we refuse to support the globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world 
because we love peace we refuse to support their zionistdriven globalist wars a new paradigm of human rights 
this is a new affirmation of human rights a new paradigm it is the human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom 
it is found where people yearn for human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in nature 
the globalists have global economic media political and military power but we represent the true desires of humanity for freedom 
we represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions human diversity freedom and independence 
we must resist rule of the globalists over us with a global coalition of mutually free peoples 
we are rising in every nation 
our paradigm for human freedom and diversity is growing among people all over the world 
the globalists cannot rule over us without our consent they cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of human freedom and diversity not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all mankind good for all people on this planet 
the principles we stand for we hold for our own people and for every people on the face the earth 
this is the world i am committed to the humanity i am committed to the nation in my own land that i am committed to 
i hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for humanity a new commitment to human freedom and diversity

trump appoints men who will take america back 
presidentelect donald trumps appointment of bannon flynn and sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking america back 
trump chief strategist bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on white people on his breitbart website 
national security head flynn realizes that americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical jihadists of saudi arabia over our natural allies the christian muslim and moderate secularists of syria he also understands that putin of christian russia should not be our enemy but our ally he is an avowed enemy of the jewish warmonger traitors called neocons and they in turn intensely hate this us army general who truly puts america first 
attorney general sessions has been hated for years by the jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into america and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action 
during his us senate confirmation hearings senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created america

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-11-17T07:12:32.712+02:00,dr duke and pastor dankof quote jews boasting of jewish media power," views share by dr david duke when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of shephardic and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member arthur koestler author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist eran elhaik and shlomo sand an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud 
for years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that koestler the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of jesus christ and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as koestler saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians koestlers official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell koestler told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael koestler the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him there are three fundamental issues which need to addressed the scientific evidence thehistoricallogical evidence and the reasons why the khazar theory came about part i the scientific evidencetwelve dna studies which disprove the khazar theory  a  study titled jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations share a common pool of ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  mf hammer etal proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure clustering of northern and southern populations  michael f seldin etal plos genetics doi journalpgen  found that both ashkenazi jews as well as sephardic jews showed more than  membership in the southern european group which made their results consistent with a later mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups  an april  study titled counting the founders the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the jewish diaspora  doron m behar etal plos one   e doi journalpone  found that about  of ashkenazi jews originate maternally from just four female founders who were of middle eastern origin  a january  study titled a genomewide genetic signature of jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full jewish ancestry in a large random sample of european americans  anna c need etal genome biology   r doi gbr  found that individuals with full jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no jewish ancestry this study showed that in dna terms jews both sephardic and ashkenazim cluster as a distinct groupsomething that if the khazar theory was true would be impossible  a december  study titled genomic microsatellites identify shared jewish ancestry intermediate between middle eastern and european populations  naama m kopelman etal bmc genetics    doi   found that  jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure these results support the view that the jewish populations largely share a common middle eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with nonjewish populations of european descent  a december  study titled the genomewide structure of the jewish people  doron m behar et al nature    july  doinature  analyzed individuals from  jewish diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genomewide diversity with those from  old world nonjewish populations in order to provide comprehensive comparisons between jewish and nonjewish populations in the diaspora as well as with nonjewish populations from the middle east and north africa the results identified a previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the middle east and that most jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster and that traces the origins of most jewish diaspora communities to the levant  a june  study titled abrahams children in the genome era major jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared middle eastern ancestry  atzmon et al american journal of human genetics   refuted the idea of largescale genetic contributions of central and eastern european and slavic populations to the formation of ashkenazi jewry this study found used genomewide analysis of seven jewish groups iranian iraqi syrian italian turkish greek and ashkenazi and demonstrated distinctive jewish population clusters each with shared middle eastern ancestry proximity to contemporary middle eastern populations and variable degrees of european and north african admixture this paper specifically excluded the khazar theory as an origin for presentday jews saying the genetic proximity    is incompatible with theories that ashkenazi jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted khazars or slavs  a march  study by steven m bray et al titled signatures of founder effects admixture and selection in the ashkenazi jewish population  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that the ashkenazi jewish aj population    has a common middle eastern origin with other jewish diaspora populations while concluding that the ashkenazi jewish population has had the most european admixture  a march  study by christopher l campbell et al titled north african jewish and nonjewish populations form distinctive orthogonal clusters  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences doi pnas  found that genomewide analysis of five north african jewish groups moroccan algerian tunisian djerban and libyan demonstrated distinctive north african jewish population clusters with proximity to other jewish populations furthermore the study showed the sephardic jewish genome is compatible with the history of north african jewsfounding during classical antiquity with proselytism of local populations followed by genetic isolation with the rise of christianity and then islam and admixture following the emigration of sephardic jews during the inquisition finally this study added  these populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger ashkenazi and sephardic jewish group endogamy the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships  in his book legacy a genetic history of the jewish people oxford university press usa may  harry ostrer a professor of pathology and genetics at albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university and director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center medicine concluded that jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature  jews are a race genes revealauthor uncovers dna links between members of tribe the jewish daily forward may    ostrer who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center said in his conclusion that jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race ostrer also deals specifically with the khazar theory he pointed out that the findings from the jewish hapmap project see below completely refute the theories that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of converted khazars or slavs  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post    the jewish hapmap project  a joint project of albert einstein college of medicine and new york university school of medicine was created to understand the structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to middle eastern iraqi and iranian jews this genetic split seemed to have occurred about  years ago  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post   dna studies find that ashkenazim jews have  european admixture both the behar study section  above and the atzmon study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian shlomo sand in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    eran elhaiks single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of eran elhaik from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against which any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist eran elhaik who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk günther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and after the supposed khazar infusion logic dictates that if the racial makeup of jews changed substantially after the year  ad then their

in the past few months the number of unaccompanied alien minors unlawfully entering the us soared to over  and the number of family units increased to  chair rep trey gowdy rsc informed the us house judiciary subcommittee on immigration and border security in a february  hearing on capitol hill

dr duke and pastor dankof on trumps america first foreign policy 
today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

for anyone who has heard about but not yet had a chance to learn the details about the undercover operation produced by james okeefe s project veritas about the inner workings of the democrat party youre in luck i have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles and this will be the third covering hillarys response each post include at least some if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by james okeefe  
for over a year okeefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the democrat partys factory of corruption and just this week after everyone laughed at trump for calling the election rigged okeefe began releasing portions of the shocking video he took while undercover in the videos some of the highest ranking members of the dnc make some of the most jawdropping admissions of guilt youve ever heard in your lives not the least of which is we have a call with hillarys campaign every day to go over what areas need more focus 
in the first post i wrote titled george soros master blueprint to conquer the west gets caught on camera  i go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from hillary clinton s largest donor none other than george soros  one very high ranking democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in upon receipt 
the campaign hillary clinton campaign pays the dnc the dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group and the foval group goes and executes the sh on the ground 
wow then when questioned about the legality the response was 
it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfker 
thats just the beginning the evidence gets infinitely worse then in the second post i wrote titled this video guarantees a trump win even with hillarys fraud machine  i present an honest look at both candidates and how they operate the post contains  of the released undercover footage so far so you learn exactly who is prescribing what to whom and i assure you that nothing can prepare you for what james managed to catch on film youll be sick 
then i contrast the criminal enterprise hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a  year span of donald trump  and in each of the clips spanning all those years trump is asked about potentially running for the presidency some day some of the answers are  years old and all are spontaneous unlike the scripted and now we know totally false statements we consistently get from hillary it is painfully obvious the answers trump gives are genuine and from the heart 
love him or hate him good luck arguing that trump isnt authentic in the video you get a good look at who would be in the oval office and its not the caricature that team hillary has tried so hard to create on the other hand team hillarys behavior is utterly indefensible and she knows it which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings 
theres nowhere to run now though hillary you and your staff have a lot to answer for much of which is criminal in nature go figure

Ann Tenna,2016-10-31T12:54:58.827+02:00,comment on ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation by ann tenna,"posted by david risselada 
much to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward 
according to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy 
this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not 
millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being 
the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature 
we all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility 
the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths 
these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society

Daisy Luther,2016-10-31T13:12:59.920+02:00,if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her,"michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

Nathaniel Mauka,2016-10-31T13:39:19.299+02:00,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

Prissy Holly,2016-10-26T21:21:57.313+03:00,leaked hillary would completely ban the most popular guns in america,"surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women 
friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki

sunday october   by j d heyes tags shrimp imports  chemical injections  food fraud naturalnews it seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes the less we learn about what is and isnt good for our bodies thats the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our healththe uks daily mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gellike substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exportedthe video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns shrimp in the head tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are soldvietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countriesthe video footage was shot by a vietnamese television station earlier this year since surfacing it has gone viral online on social media sites like facebook with many people expressing disgust and outragethe substance is often used in food as a thickening agent in particular for icing but many people who have watched the video are labeling the vietnamese factory and its workers as shameless and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty in addition the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products not just in vietnam but throughout the region all local shrimp suppliers do this environmental protection organization greenpeace recently released a report titled dodgy prawns as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems or that utilize toxic chemicalsthe guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around australia but also ecologically certified black tiger prawns from vietnam the organization also warned against all imported vannamei which very often is sourced from vietnam because of concern about mangrove destruction pollution and the use of invasive species natural blaze  in reporting on the story  noted that workers at the vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because all local shrimp suppliers do thisthe site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries including china which has a welldeserved reputation for unclean unsanitary food productionin the us about  million pounds of shrimp  or about  percent of the amount of shrimp americans consume annually  comes from vietnam which in turn gets most of its shrimp from china where food regulation is a cruel joke added weight means additional profits natural blaze reported that after about  million worth of shrimp was imported into the us from china between january and october  the us food and drug administration issued an import alert in december of that year the alert warned importers of the presence of new animals drugs andor unsafe food additives in seafood originating in china and that included shrimpthe daily mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as carboxymethyl cellulose or cmc many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the shrimpbut obviously cmc is not a naturallyoccurring element either which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural  and the substance has been linked to diarrhea abdominal cramps eye pain and irritation and lingering changes in vision natural blaze notedand yet its use in food continues thats because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight and even if retailers arent doing the injecting they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source

sunday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags superbugs  antibiotics abuse  big pharma naturalnews as new guidelines set forth by the us food and drug administration fda to curb antibiotic overuse and abuse on factory farms slowly come into effect the drug industry is apparently setting its greedy sights elsewhere  towards countries where restrictions on antibiotic use are looser or simply where anything goeslivestock are the single biggest consumers of antibiotic drugs in the us  not by choice of course but because farmers have long been sold a bill of goods by big pharma when it comes to using them to bulk up their cattle more quickly and get them to market as fast as possible its a common practice that generates a lot of money in the shortterm but a whole lot of problems in the longtermthe use of antibiotics on farms is arguably the biggest contributor to antibiotic resistance among humans where drugs that used to treat deadly bugs no longer do the result is the emergence of socalled superbugs that are capable of outsmarting even the most potent antibiotics a phenomenon thats killing people by the hundreds of thousandssome of the latest reports indicate that the superbug epidemic is claiming the lives of some  people annually all around the world and if nothing is done now to stop the drug industry from continuing to poison the well so to speak then this number is expected to balloon more than fold to  million lives lost by the year according to the world health organization who there are very few countries in the world with any sort of formidable plan in place to address antibiotic resistance even with the us somewhat taking the lead with voluntary fda suggestions on the matter none of this will stop drug companies from preying on the developing world that has yet to enact any sort of restrictions on antibiotic usetheyre international companies gail hansen a veterinarian and consultant who works with drug companies governments and nonprofit organizations told bloomberg  what happens in the us does certainly make a difference but its not the only market they have antibiotic resistance kills  times more people than opiate overdoses while its become common practice for factory animal rearers to exploit antibiotics as a way to fatten their stocks more quickly and supposedly keep them healthy the use of these drugs for such purposes is disastrous for public health comparatively speaking only  people die from opiate overdoses globally which translates to  times more people dying from superbugs than from the most deadly pharmaceuticals on the marketantibiotics are also overused in the realm of human medicine with some onethird of all prescriptions according to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the pew charitable trusts being completely unnecessary this translates to roughly  million prescriptions that arent even helpful either because the patients have a viral infection or dont have an infection at allthe only way anything is going to change is if big pharma is barred from selling antibiotics to farmers whose only desire is to rush their animals to market for maximum profits doctors must also be reigned in and stopped from indiscriminately handing out antibiotics whenever their patients feel any kind of ailment  and again these measures must have a global reachif some of the biggest responsible parties  namely the companies making the products  are still selling the antibiotics in other countries it just underscores that this has to be a change that happens across the

sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer tags cancer prevention  onions  quercetin naturalnews a chemical naturally occurring in onions may be able to suppress the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and perhaps even initiate cancer cell death according to a study conducted by researchers from kumamoto university in japan and published in the journal scientific reports these particular anticancer effects come from a chemical called onionin a ona the study focused on the effects of ona on the most common form of ovarian cancer epithelial ovarian cancer eoc this type of cancer has a fiveyear survival rate of only  percent it is the th most common female cancer in the united states and the fifth most lethal form of cancer in women as many as  percent of eoc patients relapse after their first course of chemotherapy kills cancer cells suppresses tumor growth in a prior study the researchers found that ona suppressed the tumorpromoting activity of a type of white blood cells known as myeloid cellsin the new study researchers further examined cellbased models of eocs firstly they found that the introduction of ona caused eoc tumor growth to slow further examination showed that ona was inhibiting the tumorboosting activities of myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs thereby confirming the findings of the prior studyprevious research has suggested that in the presence of cancer mdscs may function to suppress antitumor activity by the rest of the immune systemthe researchers also found that when combined with anticancer drugs ona boosted the ability

found that ona directly suppressed cancer cell proliferationthe researchers then performed an additional experiment giving mice with eoc oral treatment with ona and comparing them with a control group they found that the mice given ona lived longer and their tumors did not grow as aggressively no side effects were observed from the treatmentthe researchers concluded that with some additional testing ona could be used as an oral cancer treatmentona is considered useful for the additional treatment of patients with ovarian cancer owing to its suppression of the protumor activation of

sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer naturalnews inexpensive nontoxic versatile and potent hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every homehydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes but many people dont understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached in this unstable form the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive but once it has reacted the only byproducts are nonreactive oxygen and water this is why when used properly hydrogen peroxide is so safehydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria viruses yeast and parasites in this context it also appears to act as an antiinflammatory natural remedies so how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you unsurprisingly many of this products greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other healthpromoting function for example a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of  percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of nonchlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the same mouthwash can also remove bad breathif you think youre coming down with a cold stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morninghydrogen peroxide is also a potent antifungal a  mix of hydrogen peroxide and water sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry is a good way to get rid of athletes foot and other fungal infections a similar but much more diluted cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus in this case dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant replace your cosmetics you can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home mixed with baking soda it makes a great toothpaste it can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while such as that in a humidifier or steamer  a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth similarly you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner let it sit for  minutes and then scrubwhen properly diluted hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins just mix  quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or moreother cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses  it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses  or helping to remove ear wax buildup a few drops in the ears followed by a few drops of olive oil will cause earwax to break up and drain outhydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair household uses hydrogen peroxide isnt just for your body it can also be for your dogs hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects vomiting should only be induced upon a vets recommendation howeverfinally hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry more carefully applied it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration this is particularly effective with blooduse caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics but if you have a fresh organic stain you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide wait a few minutes it should foam and then rinse it off with cold water and soap sources for this article

Vicki Batts,2016-10-27T11:36:23.054+03:00,top doctors chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to give no benefit,"did you know that cinnamon can boost intelligence 
saturday october   by amy goodrich tags cinnamon  intelligence  parkinsons disease naturalnews cinnamon is one of the worlds most consumed spices for thousands of years it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet warming taste aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandmas apple pie researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skillsscientists at rush university medical center in chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of poor learning mice recently their findings were published in the journal of neuroimmune pharmacology in an article entitled cinnamon converts poor learning mice to good learners implications for memory improvementthe study was supported by grants from the national institutes of health the us department of veterans affairs and the alzheimers association how cinnamon affects the brain for the study lead researcher kalipada pahan a neurology professor at rush university medical center and his team zoomed in on two key proteins gabra and creb located in the hippocampus region of the brain the hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates organizes and stores memory previous research has shown that lower levels of creb and higher levels of gabra occur in the brain of poor learnersto see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with  holes the experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target holewhen they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills they could find their target hole twice as fastpahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate a chemical compound used to treat brain damage furthermore they discovered that when benzoate entered the mices brains it increased creb decreased gabra and stimulated hippocampal neurons which led to improved memory and learning skillswe have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning pahan saidhowever no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners but pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners cinnamon may halt the progression of parkinsons disease pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with parkinsons disease when cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate it works to protect the neurons normalize brain cells and improve communication within the brain which slows down the progression of the diseasegiven their promising results pahan and his team  supported by grants from the national institutes of health  plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with parkinsons diseasethis could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in parkinsons patients pahan said it would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease he addedbefore starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes know that not all cinnamon is created equal pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the united states  chinese or cassia cinnamon and ceylon cinnamon while both metabolize into sodium benzoate ceylon cinnamon is much better than chinese cinnamon chinese cinnamon contains coumarin a molecule that can damage the liver  sources",english,naturalnews.com,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/EditorialUse/Editorial-Use-Donald-Trump-American-Flag.jpg,junksci,Fake,hospitals raise

J. D. Heyes,2016-10-27T11:36:25.543+03:00,george soros on tape trump will win popular vote in landslide but hillary clintons electoral victory is already a done deal,"leaked email shows monsanto executive vp invited to hillraiser fundraiser to put clinton into the white house for monsantos benefit 
  monsanto  hillary clinton fundraiser  charles burson naturalnews wikileaks email  part of the john podesta email leaks reveals that the hillary clinton campaign sought money from a top monsanto executive to put her into the white house see the email here hillary clinton known as the bride of frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the clinton regime which even a former fbi official now describes as a criminal operation the monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than charles w burson monsantos former executive vp secretary and general counsel burson who retired from monsanto in  but still maintained an active monsantocom email address all the way through  was praised by monsanto ceo hugh grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations its sickening via pr newswire  on behalf of the monsanto board of directors and the employees of monsanto i thank charles for his service to our company said hugh grant chairman president and chief executive officer of monsanto during his tenure monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the united states but also in latin america and asiapacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant monsanto seeds and technologies clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind in other words charles burson was instrumental in monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified monsanto seeds  this legal action by monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the hillary clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put hillary clinton into the white house where no doubt she would return the favor to monsanto through government policy decisions at the usda and fdafully consistent with the criminal conduct of the clinton crime mafia charles burson also took part in excusing monsantos illegal bribery of over  indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersafter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in indonesia monsantos then general counsel charles burson explained that no monsanto isnt a bad company theyre super honest and transparent and ethical toothe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in indonesia at every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company we are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote burson surprise the justice department then defers prosecution of monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened whaddaya know with the corrupt lawless justice department calling the shots monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in washingtonfrom the same link above the justice department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement so wait you mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing  foreign officials in indonesia  a felony crime under us law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on and the justice department says oh yes youre fine now there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes and then the clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said hey this guy would be awesome to help support a clinton presidencyyepthats hillary clinton in a nutshell hopelessly corrupt criminally involved collusion at every level and the total abandonment of human rights and human dignity this woman shouldnt be behind a desk at the oval office she should be behind bars oh and it case youre curious here are all the other emails that were ccd in that same hillary clinton fundraiser message  check out some

  clinton corruption  john podesta  crime family naturalnews its not just that the corruption and criminality of the clintons knows no bounds its also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy truth and ethics their mission put our nations worst political criminal into the white house by any means necessary including systematic lying fraud money laundering intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her the clinton machine is a mafia operation  and every person involved in it must go to jailthat includes not just the deep operatives like podesta lynch and abedin but also all the deep cover clinton operatives pretending to be journalists  including stephanopoulos maddow hayes milbank and all the rest  see the list here  every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the united states of america and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy steal the election and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind barsa former fbi official said sunday that bill and hillary clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into hillary clintons private email server while she was secretary of state reports thehillcom  kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liarhe also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private serverthe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all

monday october   by j d heyes tags flint  water crisis  epa coverup naturalnews the federal bureaucracy and corresponding state agencies have never been much good at responding to crises in a timely fashion and that tradition was alive and well during the recent toxic water crisis in flint michiganin fact according to a newly released watchdog report americans now know that the federal environmental protection agency epa could have intervened in the crisis a full seven months before it finally did meaning thousands of residents in flint would have had to drink far less water tainted with leadas reported by the associated press  the epas inspector general said that the agency had the authority and enough information to issue emergency orders to protect flint residents from the leadcontaminated water they were drinking as early as june  seven months before officials finally declared an emergencyinspector general arthur elkins said in an interim report that the water crisis should have created a greater sense of urgency for the epa to intervene when the safety of drinking water is compromised everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else the drinking water in flint became tainted with unsafe levels of lead after city officials decided to begin drawing from the flint river in april  in a bid to save money the broke city of about  residents north of detroit was under state control at the timeregulators did not make sure that the water was properly treated so lead from aging pipes leached into the supply the ap reportedsince the discovery of high levels of lead federal state and local officials have traded accusations about who is most to blame for the crisis  even as residents are still forced to drink bottled or filtered waterdoctors have detected higher than normal levels of lead in hundreds of children around the city and many taps remain offlimitsgov rick snyder a republican appointed a panel to look into the matter it concluded that the state is fundamentally accountable for the lead crisis due to decisions made by state environmental regulators as well as stateappointed emergency managers who were in charge of running the citybut that said once the epa discovered that water being consumed by city residents was tainted with unsafe levels of lead snyder believes the agency should have acted  and he is rightas gov snyder has stated all along what happened in flint was the result of failure of government at all levels his spokeswoman anna heaton said recentlysince the crisis began officials have tried to reshuffle the deck so to speak and call it reform they say some state agencies have undergone culture changes that will supposedly prevent future recurrences of epic failure according to heaton who called such changes encouraging people should be held accountable  but wont be its unclear how many people actually believe that considering that state agencies had mandates already to protect the public from polluted and contaminated water as did the epa by culture changes does heaton mean that people were fired and actually replaced by others who will do what taxpayers are paying them to doflint mayor karen weaver a democrat who took office after the crisis emerged said agencies like the epa and the michigan department of environmental quality are there to help ensure the wellbeing and safety of men women and children yet they failed in their core mission to do so she also called for those who are responsible for the crisis to be held accountable though we advise her not to hold her breathas for the epas inspector general report it said that the agencys midwest region did not issue an emergency order because officials concluded actions taken by the state prevented the epa from doing so the report says that their interpretation was not correct and that according to federal law when state actions are deemed to be unacceptable the epa can and should proceed with an emergency order designed to protect the public in a timely mannerwithout epa intervention the conditions in flint persisted and the state continued to delay taking action to require corrosion control or provide alternative

monday october   tags james comey  fbi mutiny  clinton investigation naturalnews as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media  another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi according to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in america  fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt actjames comey long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations now finds himself with his back against the wall if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi he will face the wrath of obama the clintons the corrupt loretta lynch doj and the entire leftist media if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames agents inside the fbi in other words refuse to allow james comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the clinton crime family via the daily mail uk  james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director this dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through james comeys reputation as he is the fbi official who reportedly ordered the execution of robert lavoy finicum whose suspected execution by fbi agents was caught on tape because the oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury it means fbi head james comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man under comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the fbi  comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free for many fbi agents who have spent their entire careers serving the fbi as honest dedicated federal agents the thought of allowing james comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the fbis hardwon reputation is just too much to bearresignations are beginning to pile up on comeys desk as livid fbi agents head for the exitsvia the daily mail the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom and while the decision to reopen the case may appease fbi agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence as such we continue to question just how long comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james comey is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james comey is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the clinton investigations comey will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james comey doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary clinton  he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dccomey in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from loretta lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if comey gives hillary clinton a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james comey if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary clinton and loretta lynch if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary clinton and loretta lynch should be behind bars  clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary clinton campaign implodes either before or on november th comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary clinton had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall comey would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence comey could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to james comeys home address along with notes that say something like youre next lets watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be

monday october   by natural news editors naturalnews ive been trying to figure out what common trait binds clinton supporters together as far as i can tell the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its formsif you have a trump sign in your lawn they will steal itif you have a trump bumper sticker they will deface your carif you speak of trump at work you could get

are the only reasons writers write about other writersjoe biden said he wanted to take trump behind the bleachers and beat him up no one on clintons side disavowed that call to violence because i assume they consider it justified hyperboleteam clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils i have seen in my lifetime her side has branded trump supporters  of voters as nazis sexists homophobes racists and a few other fighting words their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion but facts dont matter because facts never matter in politics what matters is that clintons framing of trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person no one can be a bad person for opposing hitler rightsome trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for trump should wear their trump hats on election day that is a dangerous idea and i strongly discourage it there would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack but on election day inviting those attacks is an extradangerous idea violence is bad on any day but on election day republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights things will get wet fastyes yes i realize trump supporters say bad things about clinton supporters too i dont defend the bad apples on either side ill just point out that trumps message is about uniting all americans under one flag the clinton message is that some americans are good people and the other  are some form of deplorables deserving of shame vandalism punishing taxation and violence she has literally turned americans on each other it is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to doill say that againas far as i can tell the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn americans against each other clinton is doing that intentionally intentionally as i often say i dont know who has the best policies i dont know the best way to fight isis and i dont know how to fix healthcare or trade deals i dont know which tax policies are best to lift the economy i dont know the best way to handle any of that stuff and neither do you but i do have a bad reaction to bullies and ive reached my limiti hope you have too therefore i endorse donald trump for president of the united states because i oppose bullying in all its forms i dont defend trumps personal life neither trump nor clinton are role models for our children lets call that a tie at worstthe bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a

keywords best foods for eye health  betacarotene  cataracts  eye health  foods that contain antioxidants  free radicals  lutein  macular degeneration  maintaining healthy eyes  mesozeaxanthin  natural vision training  naturally occurring antioxidants  ocular migraines  optic nerve damage  protect your eyes  vitamin c  vitamin e  zeaxanthin 
when most people think about their eye health  the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about for example there are a staggering  common disorders that can plague your eyes these issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines fortunately there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy 
nutrients your eyes need 
there are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals as natural news has pointed out before free radicals are the main basis of all injuries illnesses and deaths 
antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye but what happens when something interrupts this process sadly you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness 
instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen you can be proactive and start taking supplements the good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although this isnt usually disclosed on the label in fact it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin 
of course this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products however their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients in addition to stocking up on these supplements it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c and beta carotene 
food sources 
there are many foods that contain antioxidants  carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene it would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource though you can also turn to oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins these are some of the best foods for eye health even better you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs pistachios corn peppers and kale with enough of these food items in your diet you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy 
additional eye health tips 
if you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health now is a good time to carefully consider quitting unfortunately people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts if you begin abstaining from tobacco products now though your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline 
other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible if you use a computer for work take a  second vision break every  minutes 
ultimately combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life if youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises this is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses as usual the natural way is better 
about the author 
jade rich is an lpn and director at an inpatient rehabilitation center as a mother of three children she is always looking for natural ways to keep her kids eyes healthy she knows from experience that another way to do this is by scheduling them for routine eye exams this helps with early detection and prevention its best to schedule this during the backtoschool season during the visit their pediatrician examines their eye alignment and gives a test for visual acuity

tuesday november   by j d heyes tags china  organ harvesting  political prisoners naturalnews in the us these days supporting gop presidential nominee donald j trump will earn you an assault from leftwing cowards and bullies who support democratic nominee hillary clinton  but in china being a political dissident and opposing the ruling communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating roomwhere youll have your organs removed for waiting transplant touristsas reported by the epoch times  chinese officials began persecuting the  million practitioners of falun gong in july  and have continued to do so ever since to the chinese communists there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulnessnot long ago this kind of treatment of chinese dissidents would draw loud rebukes from the us government the united nations and various human rights organizations around the world as well as major media coverage but since the chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the worlds advanced countries outrage has been mutedthe lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the chinese communists a green light to treat falun gong  and anyone else deemed a political dissident  in any barbaric way they choose a new form of evil hence the creation of a cottage industry of sorts  transplant tourism as the epoch times noted this is essentially  murder on demand  for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to china for a transplant operation it is a huge source of revenue both for the chinese military and for private hospitals around the country according to nobel prize nominees and investigators david matas an international human rights attorney and david kilgour a former canadian foreign secretary for asiapacificmatas and kilgour published their first investigative report in   and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in china from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since the investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience primarily followers of falun gong  the largest group in chinas prisonsin their  report matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from falun gong adherents by the chinese communist party as a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planetone of the founding board members of doctors against forced organ harvesting dafoh dr dana churchill spoke at rallies in los angeles and santa monica beach earlier this month she said that to this point the world had never witnessed a more horrific and barbaric crime as the chinese communist party has committed against falun gong crime against humanity she added that it wasnt just falun gong adherents who were being victimized however others include christians the uyghurs and tibetans all of whom have also had their organs harvested while they are alive unwilling and between  and  years

washington dc rally on july   following nine years of investigation the world organization to investigate the persecution of falun gong announced that it had concluded that since july   the chinese communist party ccp lead by its former head jiang zemin has utilized chinas entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living falun gong practitioners as a way to physically destroy the group as a

of the earth child writes noting that this is not the method liautaud uses to kill his prey trophy hunters will leave out bait play the sounds of other animals to lure them in or a few other tactics to find their animal victimscanned hunting is even worse she adds it is the shooting fish in a barrel version of trophy hunting  the animals are often hand raised so they are tame and dont run away they leave food out for them one day then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle sometimes they dont even have to creep sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck then go back to drinking their gin  tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun trophy hunting costs do not help repopulate endangered animal species one of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies plains and jungles with endangered species but this isnt actually true as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposesnontrophy hunting tourism on the other hand is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations  up to  times than what trophy hunting contributes  according to heather callaghan editor of natural blaze  likewise the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers

take oil to a refinery facility in illinois is being built as protestors objecting to the project are clashing with increasingly militarized police  the bismark tribune reported that police and protestors clashed as authorities moved in to break up a camp on private property belonging to the pipeline developersprotestors had initially formed a line of no surrender the paper said but it became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of dakota access pipeline protestors pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main campfor about five hours on thursday beginning around noon police officers pressed the protesters back about a halfmile on nd highway  which was away from a new camp they had built earlier in the week that sat directly atop the pipeline easement rubber bullets bean bags smoke grenades and tasers unrest continued into the evening hours however as police said that two fires were started on a nearby bridge and protestors began lobbing molotov cocktails at officers in addition police reported two incidents where shots were firedthe tribune reported that one woman allegedly fired a handgun in the direction of police as she was being arrested while an armed man who was reportedly run off the road by protesters and was perhaps not connected to the protest had to be treated for a gunshot wound to the handas police moved in some protestors were urging calm and prayer but others threw rocks and water bottles at approaching officers eventually the crowd retreated under a barrage of pepper spray

tuesday november   by vicki batts tags fda  adhd drugs  market withdrawal naturalnews adhd medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time two years ago the fda said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular adhd drug known as concerta the generic produced by the pharmaceutical company mallinckrodt just wasnt up to snuff and now the fda seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelvesgeneric drugs are approved by the fda through their abbreviated new drug application anda process in the anda process the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug or what many people refer to as the brand name drugthe term bioequivalent means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product specifically it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time at the same dose and under the same conditions should exhibit similar results as the fda explains on their website the generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patients bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drugunsurprisingly discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approvedmallinckrodts concerta generic is not the only brand name knockoff under fire kremers urban pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of the lannett company also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder has deemed insufficientas reported by the regulatory affairs professionals society cder tracked the issues from december  through june  ran a reanalysis of bioequivalence data and determined that the mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than concerta during the time period of  to  hours postdosing following the cders findings mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit which was thrown out by a maryland federal judge the pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace and according to the fda the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to concertasimilarly the cder concluded in june of  that the data on the kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to concerta in november that year the fda announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brandboth manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the fda within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldnt be withdrawnof course the fdas concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs in  a cbs news report revealed that  people died and  more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of adhd medication in a period of just four yearsthat may not seem like a lot but is important to recall that the fda adverse event reporting system faers which is used to track such events is a voluntary system only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events  if they know about them doctors patients and family members are under no such obligation psqh reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about  percent of all adverse events will even be reported  who is to say how many people have been harmed by adhd medications and other drugs and dont know it or havent reported itthe faers website itself states that because of its own limitations faers data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the us population and yet in spite of this very statement the fda itself used this information to form a safety reportover the years several adhd medications like adderall xr have been linked to sudden death  cardiovascular problems and psychosis according to consumer reports  the longterm safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years many kids take adhd

tuesday november   tags donna brazile  cheating democrats  racketeering naturalnews dirty donna brazile political filth on display the stench of dirty democrat tactics has now reached a new nauseating milestone in america with the revelation that dirty donna brazile a dnc operative working for clinton smuggled debate questions out of cnn and handed them over to the clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that hillary clinton could cheatyes hillary clinton cheated in the debates as ive said all along they were  rigged by cnn the clinton news network which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open fair and free elections in americacnn commentator donna brazile who is now the chair of the democratic national committee was caught again passing debate questions from the network to the clinton campaign during the democratic primary reports breitbartcom dirty donna brazile was caught so blatantly that even cnn had to fire her to create the appearance that cnn is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism funneling town hall and debate questions to hillary clinton days before the events the daily caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by dirty donna brazile on behalf of the corrupt criminalminded clintons donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday showthe email threads also show that brazile a former cnn contributor revealed to the clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of clinton at a march  town hall cohosted by cnn and tv one brazile also shared a question from a debate hosted by cnn a week earliera march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tappera march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich arrest brazile mills podesta schultz abedin and clinton what we are all witnessing here with these revelations about cheating corruption obstruction of justice bribery and vote fraud is nothing less than the inner workings of a criminal cartel composed of a modern day political mafia all these political scumbags need to go to jail they are all guilty of serious crimes against the united states and against democracy itself they respect no law they follow no rules they cheat lie deceive steal and intimidate their way to power election after election they live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood sweat and tears of the american middle class who are barely staying afloat while washington elitists like brazile abedin and clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the hunger games but its not president snow we have to worry about in the real world its the haunting possibility of a president clinton why we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on november th and once thats accomplished we must petition president trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the hundreds of seditious traitors inside the clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across americathere are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life they are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society they are sociopaths liars cheats and even murderers they are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weakminded ie democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for hillary  if we dont stop them now they threaten to turn america into a fourth reich  complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the clinton regimethese democrats like dirty donna brazile want to run america like haiti  complete with all the corruption bribery scandals and economic collapse that third world countries routinely sufferbut filthy scumbags like brazile are about to find out something rather shocking we the people wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal  we will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the us armed forces depose you and remove you from office  to announce new elections without the festering cancerous stench of the dnc and the clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filthwe the people have had enough of you demons you creatures from hell you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in washington your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end and you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom  racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of  more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton  followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary

tuesday november   by lj devon staff writer tags heart failure  pain management  antioxidants naturalnews when elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen their risk of heart failure increases this is the finding of a uk study published in the british medical journal  the study investigated  million people with an average age of  from the uk the netherlands italy and germany those who took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids were rushed to the hospital with heart failure  percent more often than those who did not take the drugs the same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of  but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for longterm health regular use of nsaids is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life using these overthecounter painkillers may take the edge off the pain but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place and old age is not the reason for the painfor this reason elderly patients could benefit more from natural antiinflammatory substances that work with the bodys healing process over time giving the body phytonutrients such as astaxanthin curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than nsaids these plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular levelnumbing the pain is not enough and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed leading to heart failure  pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown an imbalance or a deficiency when nsaids are thrown at the problem regularly there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces when the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired better pain management essential for the elderly flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as medicine the aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine the inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systemsnatural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population however the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants these real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress something as simple as siberian ginseng  eleutherococcus senticosus  can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina this root contains a powerful combination of sterols

monday october   by j d heyes tags zika virus  medical hoax  infectious disease naturalnews one of the most interesting things about the zika virus is that it is not a new ailment it was first discovered in monkeys in  and in humans in  according to a fact sheet from the world health organization while researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified some of the health problems now being associated with zika  such as microcephaly in newborns  have never before been seen leaving many to wonder if there isnt some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agendafor instance according to truthwiki  an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease populations in the past that were heavily infected with zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head the current outbreak is far from being the only one in the s outbreaks occurred in oceania and southeast asia and in  the socalled yap epidemic which occurred on the yap main island  part of the caroline island chain in the western pacific  infected threequarters of the population but no cases of newborn birth defects like microcephaly were reported so the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to zika appears completely unwarranted will we see another swine flu fiasco with the zika vaccine the same year truthwiki reported using funding that was provided by the bill and melinda gates foundation a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by oxitec oxford insect technologies a british biotechnology company roughly two years later in the fall of  gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic aedes aegypti mosquitoes which are the species known to transmit the disease they were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquitoborne diseases including dengue yellow fever and zika  among others the plan was to get the gm mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth thereby halting the spread of the disease but truthwiki noted there was another agendain may  the who and the brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly  million suspected cases of zika in brazil and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread to include areas of drinking water the propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water then they too had to be treated with the chemical which was then spread primarily over povertystricken areasthe next thing we know scores of cases involving microcephaly in brazil began cropping up and they were then blamed on zika coincidence many think not whats more there were really only about  children born malformed  not plus as originally reported truthwiki points outas truthwiki notes further zika is a mild viral infection  always has been  and resembles the typical cold or flu most of those afflicted with it suffer a lowgrade fever some pain in their joints a skin rash and conjunctivitis in other cases people have no idea theyve even been infected if symptoms appear at all they may last up to a week but like chicken pox a onetime zika infection can provide lifelong immunity while severe cases of zika may require hospitalization they are rare as are zikarelated deaths overkill and yet despite the virus relatively mild symptoms the us government is set to pay a japanese big pharma firm as much as  million to develop a vaccine  natural news reported recently if thats not overkill then nothing is  especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives another disease outbreak emergency another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market in fact due to the gravity and dire nature of the zika emergency we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mids then a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness which only killed one person led to a dramatic spike in guillainbarre syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing paralysis ironically today the centers for disease control and prevention is claiming that zika may be causing gbspropaganda anyoneread the entire truthwiki report on the zika hoax here

wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to

over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is

america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking

wednesday november   by j d heyes tags food poverty  hunger  obama administration naturalnews a democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another democratic president barack obama she is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them and yet by any true measure the economy has been a disaster under obama real growth has nearly flatlined  real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration  and  million americans cannot get enough food without government assistancein fact on that last point and as reported by natural blaze  in the obama economy in americans are going to bed hungry on most nights if not every nightand clinton wants to double down on obamas economic policies how can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry americans for the past eight years americans have had to listen to lectures from obama and other democrats about how we as a firstworld nation should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and increasingly to noncitizens  but shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooof course but malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the us thats because in real terms workers wages are falling and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tablesfor many particularly the low paid sic this means two things fuel and food poverty  natural blaze reportedlow salaries combined with stagnant wages jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury and of those who can still afford food many have to settle for cheap nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches carbohydrates and calories now winter approaches and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil which traditionally produce higher pricesbut the establishment media is part of the problem for example in february bloomberg reported that in americans were on food stamps despite an economic recovery  no one should ever be hungry in america unless they choose to be what recovery obamas economy is growing at about  percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing themso the caveat is disingenuous a more accurate story would have reflected on the in figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among americans to find better employment opportunities in fact the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a in ratio is no big deal or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people which is itits the latter of course and while america will always have a portion of the population that is too sick too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the treasury  the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth in todays america that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry but is actually causing them to go hungryand that should never happen

J. D. Heyes,2016-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00,americas shrimp imports being injected with dangerous chemicals  just to add weight,"this smart harmless pesticide patent could take down monsanto and change the world 
wednesday november   by j d heyes tags mushrooms  monsanto  pesticides naturalnews is bioagriculture giant monsanto king of genetically modified foods and seeds about to suffer an irreversible decline while the planet earth gets a huge chemical reprievewell it may be a bit too early to declare the st louisbased corporation dead in the water but that day may soon be upon us thanks to a nifty new pesticide patent that would make bioag chemicals unnecessaryas reported by the website anonymous  one man who has dedicated his life to the study of mushrooms may have just stumbled upon the one invention that will dramatically change the way we protect food crops from voracious pestspaul stamets has unearthed medical cure after cure and he says the key to saving the planet can be found in the mushroomstamets one of the worlds leading mycologists  if not the top researcher of fungi  filed a patent in  that has since been all but ignored why because most of his research has been viewed as hostile to conventional industries including the pesticide industry anonymous notes that some executives of the pesticide industry have remarked that the patent he filed was the most disruptive they had ever seen kills pests naturally and with zero impact on the environment and indeed a read of the patent reveals a remarkable claimthe present invention relates to the use of fungal mycelium as a biopesticide more particularly the invention relates to the control and destruction of insects including carpenter ants fire ants termites flies beetles cockroaches and other pests using fungal mycelia as both attractant and infectious agent the patent saysin other words fungus that can be present on crops will both attract destructive pests and then infect and kill them after they have eaten it in his patent stamets claims that more than one fungus can be used in combination can be dried or freezedried then packaged and reactivated for use as an effective bioinsecticideno more chemicals no more spraying no more need for monsantos chemicalfirst approach to growing our foodin his patent stamets noted that the widespread use of chemical pesticides is a primary cause of a number of secondary environmental problems that occur besides the death of targeted pests they include soil poisoning the toxifying of underlying water tables and aquifers as well as the pollution of surface water due to runoffin addition they lead to increases in cancer allergies neurological diseases immune disorders even the deaths of some agricultural workers and consumers have been linked to the use of chemical pesticidesincreasingly regulated and even banned in some countries chemical pesticides like monsantos roundup with the cancercausing primary ingredient glyphosate  have become so dangerous that many communities are scrambling for natural solutions to pest problems who knew mushrooms could be so lethal to pests this guy did compounding these problems many pest type or vermin insects have developed a broad spectrum of resistance to chemical pesticides resulting in few commercially available pesticides that are effective without thorough and repeated applications the patent says in addition to being largely ineffective and difficult and costly to apply chemical pesticides present the further disadvantage of detrimental effects on nontarget species resulting in secondary pest outbreaksbut his invention he wrote offers the agriculture industry an environmentally benign alternative to insect control by working to attract insects that latent preconidial mycelium that is fresh dried or freezedried that later infects and kills the hostinfected insects will then carry the fungal hyphae back to the central colony then disperse the fungal pathogen even furtherin essence he wrote fungal mycelium is both a baitattractant as well as a food insecticide and all without harming one thing in the environmentits a harmless pesticide that works without genetically modifying our food poisoning our earth and filling humans with toxins using just mushroomsnow  who will step up and market it you can bet it wont be monsanto

the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business 
the global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire all of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system money is necessary for our survival in the real world today most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system if money is the god of our time that makes rothschild his prophet public school programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds they continue the shaping through the media we are taught what they want us to know and nothing more 
the rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses when the top  percent owns the majority of banks resources and even our governments it means big problems for the people the rothschilds are worth over  trillion and they are just  of  families that pretty much collectively own the world the rothschilds alone could pay off the us national debt  times over unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks the new world orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources

the new york times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission  to report america and the world honestly without favors and fear the paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public this announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race 
sean hannity suggests that trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts he was sad to see the yearold paper destroy their credibility over the election season it was obvious to dedicated readers that the times had abandoned its old coverage standards stories were unrelentingly hostile towards trump and his supporters reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage this allowed animosity toward trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters front page stories on the new york times were accusing trump of lying but the paper never published the same findings in reference to hillary clinton  the papers liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes newt gingrich destroys the new york times credibility with seven simple questions 
the new york times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former united states house of representatives speaker gingrich a republican has asked the times whether they have any reporters editors or columnists that will say they voted for trump he elaborated to ask if they have since hired any trump supporters to work those positions for the times the paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any republican reporters at all 
gingrich has also asked if the new york times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering the fourth question asked by gingrich wondered if the times reporters would surrender any pulitzer prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions here are the final questions that the times struggled to address have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions  such as the papers coverage of trumps tax returns has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated news stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop trump has it retracted its shameful electioneve frontpage story reporting on trumps innermost thoughts and feelings virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters opinions and speculationsfeaturing claims like he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention

clinton said 
hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little 
hillary clinton is in a great position but judging from her own remarks she is still working hard to close the deal on november

earlier in the day two bloomberg polls that had trump leading florida by  points and cutting clintons new hampshire lead in half gave republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening but the reality is that voting is already underway in  states there are very few undecided voters remaining

hopefully as a country well return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare but this year when the man at the top of the republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses isnt likely to be that time

this type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics 
after all not long ago trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate supreme court judges 
if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks the republican nominee said although the second amendment people  maybe there is i dont know 
more recently trump said that hed like to see what happens if clintons bodyguards were disarmed 
i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons disarm immediately he said take their guns away lets see what happens to her 
not only does walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former republican congressman seems to enjoy using 
earlier in the year when five police officers were gunned down in dallas walsh blamed president obama tweeting this is now war watch out obama watch out black lives matter punks real america is coming after you 
before trump hit the scene this type of rhetoric existed but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee

the th woman has come forward to accuse donald trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape 
in a story that sounds very familiar former miss finland ninni laaksonen told the tabloid iltasanomat that the now republican nominee grabbed her butt just before trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the late show with david letterman in  
before the show we were photographed outside the building laaksonen is quoted by haaretz  trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt he really grabbed my butt i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought what is happening 
as to the veracity of these claims it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out iltasanomat the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia  reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story 
in case youre not already grimacing the former miss finland added somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of  melania trump is now  so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in  
new york magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against donald trump 
donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench i mean that is supposed to be how this works right a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it

in a conference call with reporters gen john allen ret said trumps remarks are not only uninformedbut it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops and i took great exception to this however he feels personally about this operation he should be encouraging our efforts publicly rather than disparaging them 
 
while trump appears not to understand basic military activities its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them either because there are a number of experts who i thinkwould advise him otherwise but he seems to be confident in his knowledge and that knowledge i think reveals a lot about what he doesnt know 
 
this kind of rhetoric this kind of disrespect for our military leadership this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be commanderinchief 
military experts like gen allen feel compelled to criticize the republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief 
thanks to donald trump the republican party has become the party that doesnt support the troops 
republicans have gone from real america to unamerican in record time

candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in florida democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by four points  and democratic us senate candidate patrick murphy is tied with republican incumbent sen marco rubio  by an almost two toone margin  florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for us senate who supports strengthening gun laws suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month 
the poll was conducted by ppp the americans for responsible solutions pac and it illustrates the dilemma that the florida senate race has created for democrats democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive florida media but there are polls that suggest that sen marco rubios democratic challenger rep patrick murphy has a chance of winning the seat 
if rep murphy can beat sen rubio the defeat would likely put an end to rubios national political career or at least force the florida republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in  and instead focus on a run for governor 
democrats have a real chance to send marco rubio to the unemployment line rubio has been a disinterested senator who just like ted cruz seems only interest in his senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions rubio has provided poor service to his constituents  and doesnt deserve to return to the us senate 
sen rubio has refused to commit to serving his full senate term which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them

nope 
did pence read the story no but hes offended so offended because that kind of language is offensive not the actual suppression of the votes but the language because its not our operation 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation pence denied 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election and thats our message is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them that we can have government as good as our people again but its going to take all of us 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign its not the approach were taking were reaching out to every american 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in  pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because its just not what i see out there 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together it turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts this is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts 
pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters but why would he 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign 
like trump pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior

the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of  showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of  the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with us economy roars back grew  in third quarter 
jason furman chairman of the council of economic advisers summarized the numbers real gdp grew  percent at an annual rate in the third quarter with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix the trump economic plan creates at least  million jobs boosts growth up to  percent and is revenue neutral trumps website claims 
before these numbers trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent isnt revenue neutral and would destroy  million jobs trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run 
the conservativeleaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by  trumps tax plan could cost the us  million jobs 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections the analysis shows that if implemented the democratic nominees agenda would create  million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of  percent 
under trumps plan moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to  percent and over  million americans would be put out of work the us economy will weaken significantly if mr trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed the june report said the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early  and extends into even longer than the great recession

trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts trump earned a pants on fire from politifact for this claim made june th  in his presidential announcement speech the last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product  was below zero who ever heard of this its never below zero 
but also they note finally since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth well just throw this out of the  quarters of negative growth since world war ii  occurred under republican presidents and just  under democratic presidents

the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not the democratic nominee said 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value 
kristen welker asked if clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign to which secretary clinton responded with a big laugh are you worried this could sink your campaign secretary clinton a reporter shouts as hrc walks out clinton only lets out a big laugh 
 ruby cramer rubycramer october   
the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it 
republicans and some in the press think this might sink the clinton campaign so they think america would rather put putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the white house than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip

the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed  days before the election has nothing to with trumps doa white house bid and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress 
on the surface the sudden revival of hillary clintons emails looks like an october surprise designed to help republican nominee donald trump the problem with this theory is that both democrats and republicans acknowledge that trump is toast 
unless hillary clintons emails say lol i was the shooter on the grassy knoll there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election in fact the emails fbi director was investigating did not come from clinton or her server they seem to have very little to do with hillary clinton or her presidential campaign 
the emails are like catnip to republican voters who have been promised for years that if they keep sending republicans to congress theyll bring down a democratic president and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival 
for the next ten days republican congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating hillary clinton the republican candidates can pretend like trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is vote for me and ill bring down hillary 
donald trump is a lost cause millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states trump is being out organized and trounced by clinton on the ground 
to understand the real value of the email scandal to the republican party look down the ballot

the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act 
what republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy

former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller a self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case miller said on cnn but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last  days let alone the last  days 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comeys public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power  httpstcogcrozqwz 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   followed by quickly releasing fbi s something they rarely do and which i doubt they will do for future highprofile cases  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   each time he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent press conference was the original sin  it begat the rest  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   but todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   not just public discussion either often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   why because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way who is the target of an investigation what conduct  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton but no way for press or voters to know that easy for opponent to make hay over  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations then multiply that times ten close to an election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   for whatever reason  there are many theories comey continues to ignore that but only for clinton  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack manafort  the trump campaign but arent commenting on it good  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   
miller points out this just smells worse and worse the more we learn linking to this emails were not to or from clinton and appeared like info fbi already had wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi 
 ken gude kengude october   
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons 
this is quite simply not done comeys reasons for doing this are unclear and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign which seems to have lowered the bar all around

earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years 
aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park

president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail or to impeach him hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either apparently for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her  
at least that and completely ignoring the facts was the theme on fox news last night though to be fair other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday 
megyn kelly fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with newt gingrich suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte rwv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong what needs to happen is a special prosecutor 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen a special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect bob goodlatte  well first of all we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads and we have done that throughout the summer asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted we will continue to do that we dont know whats going to happen now we dont know whats going to happen after the election so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards a special prosecutor remember is appointed by the attorney general of the united states so you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation 
democracy is a fragile thing it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in  and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general however the gopled house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries appoint special prosecutors if they win or vote to impeach them outright as trumps pet snake at cnn jeffrey lord called for last night  
two points anderson one with  days left this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment her paranoia and all of the rest the second thing anderson is and this is the really disturbing thing lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election this isnt going to stop there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly i mean thats something the american people need to consider now 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead hillary clinton has committed no crimes far from being a miscarriage of justice though it is that as well this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party during the mccarthy era the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury last night it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same

nato and washingtons activities in eastern europe and the baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence sergei ermakov a senior analyst at the russian institute for strategic studies told rt adding that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg so far endless wargames and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence nato is testing a drastic military buildup we have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to eastern europe these are offensive not defensive forces what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg ermakov said 
the north atlantic alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the natorussia border on a permanent basis but has been increasingly active in the region the bloc approved its largest military buildup in eastern europe and the baltics since the end of the cold war at the  warsaw summit a development viewed with deep concern in moscow 
as part of this initiative canada germany the uk and the us will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in poland estonia latvia and lithuania each will total up to  soldiers these battalions are said to become operational in early  the alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming russia for its ostensibly assertive behavior moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims 
ermakov further explained that forces of natos european members are not as lethal as they might seem on paper this is a force exceeding russias military potential by several times but it lacks real combat power this is why americans need to be everywhere the us was forced to boost us european commands budget he said 
earlier this year the pentagon requested bn for its operations in europe in  a fourtime increase compared to its million budget this year a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that nato increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk 
the blocs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric greatly reduce european security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between russia and nato something russia has been calling for so many years instead the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results peter korzun an expert on wars and conflicts wrote for the strategic culture foundation ermakov also said that the united states wants to increase its presence in the black sea region to counter russia americans can no longer count on turkey due to the failed coup attempt ankara has become a complicated partner washington is instead focusing on bulgaria and romania he said 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg mentioned romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of natos defense ministers he said that romanian troops will join the usled battle group in poland he also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening natos presence in the black sea region in the air at sea and on land this initiative will include among other things a romanianled multinational framework brigade on land he observed providing no additional information on the subject

admin,2016-10-26T22:52:00.000+03:00,clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing,"zero hedge october   
we have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between chelsea clinton and doug band back in  after chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between bands firm teneo the clinton foundation and the state departmentsee here  here here and here  
the feud ultimately resulted in band being forced to draft a memo spelling out in vivid detail the many entangled relationships between himself teneo the clinton foundation and the state department fortunately todays wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation bands firm teneo consulting and the clinton familys private business endeavors 
the memo starts with a brief background on teneo which was created in june  shortly after declan kelly resigned from his position as united states economic envoy to northern ireland a position to which he was appointed by secretary clinton 
in june  dk consulting was founded by declan kelley mr kelly served as coo of fti consulting until june  when he stepped down and established dk consulting at that time he also became the united states economic envoy to northern ireland  pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with fti and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the state department mr kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients coke dow and ubs and one pro bono client allstate  in late  declan retained me as a consultant to dk consulting to help support the needs of these clients in may  mr kelly resigned his envoy position at the state department in june  mr kelly and i founded teneo strategies  simultaneously mr kelly closed dk consulting and shifted its clients to teneo 
throughout the past almost  years since president clinton left office i have sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation  this memorandum strives to set forth how i have endeavored to support the clinton foundation and president clinton personally 
in a subsequent section of the memo entitled leveraging teneo for the foundation band spells all of the donations he solicited from teneo clients for the clinton foundation in all there are roughly mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being cocacola barclays the rockefeller foundation and laureate international universities 
the donations from dow chemical are particularly notable for several reasons first because of other emails revealed by wikileaks and other foia requests we now know that dow chemical ceo andrew liveris was granted special access to then secretary clinton back in july  at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another clinton foundation donor kuwait over a failed jointventure that would have netted dow bn in cash  as band notes in his memo  month after being granted special access to secretary clinton liveris invited president clinton and band out for a day of golf moreover shortly after his meeting with secretary clinton and golf outing with president clinton liveris decided to donate  to the clinton global initiative very convenient timing for all involved 
in august of  mr kelly invited mr liveris to play golf with president clinton and me mr kelly subsequently asked dow to become a cgi sponsor at the  level which they did  as well as making a  donation to the foundation for president clinton to attend a dow dinner in davos 
the story gets even more bizarre when band reveals in the following footnote that liveris provided the dow chemical plane to fly president clinton and his staff from new york to california and then california to north korea for their golf outing  we would assume this is a simple typo by band andor hes just geographically challengedif not this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill 
mr liveris provided the dow plane to fly president clinton and his staff to and from california for our trip to and from north korea  as a private trip the foundation had to pay the costs of airfare mr liveris in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of   
according to the dialy caller  dow chemical paid teneo  million in  and  million in  for a variety of consultancy services of course bill clinton was an honorary chairman of teneo and as such was set to be paid  million for that position even though he ultimately only kept  because of the scandals that erupted around the firm including their advisory relationship with mf global 
finally band also offers the following commentary on the  million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for bill clinton as of november  as well as the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the foundation we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches books and advisory service engagements  in that context we have in effect served as agents lawyers managers and implementers to secure speaking business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his family  for personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements with respect to business deals for his advisory services justin and i found developed and brought to president clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current  arrangements we secured all of them and we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements 
a big part of those forprofit activities was a mm annual payment from laureate 
and millions in speaking fees arranged by band 
confused here is a simpler recap from the nyts nick confessore this doug band memo in the latest podesta dump is the rosetta stone of the teneoclinton foundation complex httpstcoagnsogpm 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   bands argument i am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff i do for clintonworld so you should let me do teneo everyone wins 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   now you could argue so what if band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity why is that bad 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   but consider that band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was in essence a way to bolster their influence 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   clinton  band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies images bathe in bcs praise and do some good while 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   teneo extracted earnings for band and depending on what you see in these emails clinton himself teneo paid clinton until late  
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   i guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger but chelsea clinton and some of clintons other aides were clearly freaking out 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   generally the emails show clintons own closest aides troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off

admin,2016-10-26T22:41:00.000+03:00,hillary takes a cookie from a little person on univision gets tequila and a huge birthday cake practices spanish dances salsa and gets called a home girl in doanything bid to crush trump in florida,"end of the american dream october   
if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable 
she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over 
someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict 
clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets 
what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it 
and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians 
according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences 
russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues 
of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants 
you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all 
thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide 
so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control 
one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  
mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said 
naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted 
anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality 
and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania  nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania 
in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia 
after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad 
a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic 
the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen søreide 
most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia 
but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  
russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats 
i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war 
in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out 
at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia 
if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time

sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean mostly made up of fecal matter and trash its where environmentalists come from 
they are effectively the pits also environmentalists hate people see top  environmentalists who openly support killing off humans  a side effect of being sad soggy little bottom dwellers so its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in montana  despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being also electric cars  but whatever 
the  residents in southeast montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders 
an out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of colstrips coalfired power plant by  the sierra club and the montana environmental information center which sued the plant see the closure as a victory 
plant operators came to an agreement with activists because oregon democratic gov signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by  
consequences 
its a win for everybody except the people employed by the coal plant also colstrips entire economy coal plant workers make money then spend that money at other businesses except now all those lads will be jobless which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore which means other businesses will suffer thanks environmentalists 
by the way green earth sjws tend to also be fans of the indians  the people not the baseball team racist that wee tidbit is worth noting considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly 
you lose two of those units and you are shutting down half the town small said this closure will have an economic impact on the reservations throughout the county and across the state small is of north cheyenne descent hes made an extra effort to recruit american indian students nearly three dozen northern cheyenne work at the colstrip plant and three times that figure work in the coal fields 
a double header bad for the economy bad for the indigenous people 
as mentioned above the coal plant never stood a chance thanks to impending regulations the plant has long seen the end drawing near possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way whatever the reason environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy

grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive

the name peter kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you although it probably should this guy is a real piece of work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates 
heres some of what we learned 
the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 
the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 
podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 
podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time 
he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe 
kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 
to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   
a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant 
the dinner was set for  that evening just a day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee 
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  and in an email sent on may   kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction 
as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation 
the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress 
last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation 
seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make 
the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article 
could the department of injustice have any less credibility

gop nominee donald trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel prompting one cnn reporter to accuse trump of taking time out of swing states meanwhile hillary clinton is again nowhere to be seen

so to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this you say bash asked 
i say the following you have been covering me for the last  long time i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches and ive been doing this for weeks straight trump responded 
for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule 
last month for example hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in orlando florida 
and in august hillary took seven of the first  days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance

gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump

 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote

the number of wild animals on earth could fall by more than twothirds in the  years to  according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution the forecast could lead to major consequences for humans 
the living planet report  says that animal losses are on track to reach  percent in the  years to  the reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a  percent plummet between  and  
the researchers analyzed the changing presence of  monitored populations of the  vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them 
according to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem vaccineladen mms to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag 
humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said wwfs director of science mike barrett a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
animals across the planet are expected to be affected however rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures 
we are no longer a small world on a big planet we are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockström said in a foreword for the report 
the decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on earths geology and ecosystems 
the notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences 
the richness and diversity of life on earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said as quoted by the guardian 
in fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition 
increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states 
there does however appear to be some hope some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis 
however barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources 
youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business barrett said 
the report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added my hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act i do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it

admin,2016-10-27T13:58:44.202+03:00,get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

britain is deploying troops aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in eastern europe since the cold war 
the deployment which was first floated in the press by uk defense chiefs on wednesday appears to have been prepared well in advance 
it will see up to  armored infantry troops deployed to estonia and royal air force raf fighter jets deployed to romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the soviet union during the cold war 
france and denmark will also commit more troops 
on wednesday uk defence secretary michael fallon struck a belligerent tone in the wall street journal when he warned that europe  is our continent  and as such would be defended 
while he claimed the force would be  defensive in nature  he pledged it would be  fully combatcapable  a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
he denied the placement of small formations around the baltic area are merely a  tripwire  in case of the muchheralded but hypothetical clash with russia 
 this is a serious military presence  he said 
tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of russian naval vessels bound for the mediterranean sea passed through the north sea and english channel 
the passage caused a press frenzy in the uk framed as though russia was launching an invasion of the british isles the royal navy deployed destroyers to in fallons words  manmark  the vessels while the raf overflew the ships with fighter jets 
according to the russian military the naval groups task was to  ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the worlds oceans  as well as  the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities  of russia

whistleblowersby kevin shippwhy dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations if these activities are so illegal why are people not coming forward to report themover the last fifty years us government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee including his or her family who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operationsas a condition of employment military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement or nondisclosure agreement before being given access to the position which offers high pay and status in the organization this agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals any information regarding the program thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job all employees eagerly sign itthis secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technologyhowever because of the binding power of the agreement government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations it was the perfect tool to threaten silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of governmenttoday the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement these penalties include huge fines termination financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families most will not reveal any wrongdoing no matter how egregious for fear of calculated severe retributionwhen employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial or to sue the agency that hired them if they try to do so as a whistle blower they find they have no right to be heard in federal court many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late that is part of the systemif the employee attempts to contact their congressman or senator their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case because they do not have the necessary clearancewhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the congressional intelligence committees their response is ignored it is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases so they refer them back to their senator or congressman who cannot access information involved in their caseif a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle a system of personal and career destruction follows this begins with promotions being denied being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments and their files being flagged ruining their reputation inside their agency at this point their career is over if they go quietly the retribution stopswhen the employee still continues their effort to report the information their travel records personnel records medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information if no substantive information can be found it is fabricated and placed in their fileemployees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations multiple hostile interviews attempting to get them to recant their information and multiple polygraph interrogationsin many cases the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation if they comply the evaluation labels them as paranoid unstable or disgruntled this information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutinyif the employee contacts a member of the news media they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them several news media outlets are connected to the cia and nsa and notify them of the employees contactfinally the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against themafter termination or forced resignation interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable the release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony the agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors further ruining them financiallydehumanized financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure the employees family begins to break apart if the familys foundation is not strong this results in alcoholism depression and divorce in some cases it has resulted in the employee committing suicide the ultimate goal of the program of destruction this silences the employee permanently obscuring the agencys role in their destruction it is the perfect crimeshould the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity classified agencies will invoke the secretive state secrets privilege which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison if the familys case reaches federal court the state secrets privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case factsnow that the employees case and in some cases their familys case is shut down and under seal citing national security the process of silencing the employee is complete many are never heard from again fearing prison if they talk to anyone including an attorneyusing attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts the us government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements this includes employees at all levels from secretaries to ceos once they have signed the secrecy agreement they are bound to keep all information including potentially illegal information quiet being threatened with the same penaltiesto date over five million americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the state secrets privilegeonly a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed sadly some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicideemployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it even to expose corruption most look the other way to protect their careers retirements and families many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists but they are not fully aware of all that is being done the full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees until its use is necessarythis is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen this system has been used and perfected for over fifty years it is being used because it worksit works unless the system is exposed the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in governmentthis support is essential not only to protect the whistle blower and their

the nras magazine acknowledged that president obama really hasnt had the opportunity to confiscate firearms undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a  massive obama conspiracy  to dismantle the second amendment and take guns away 
the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation 
the admission was included in a june  article for nra magazine americas st freedom which took issue with how obama rudely responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event 
the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
responding to obamas statement the article acknowledged now the gun store ownercould have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president 
rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it 
obama then said im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
now rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for artype rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent 
claims about gun confiscation and obama have been the nras bread and butter for the past eight years  more recently the nra has suggested that the election of clinton could lead to gun confiscation for lawabiding americans

admin,2016-10-27T16:41:39.430+03:00,uk economy grows pc in the wake of brexit vote defying recession fears,"during the height of the cold war the cia attempted to develop mind control techniques with the mkultra program as it happens the communists already had a leg up on them well explore how this was done along with some new twists
the criticism and selfcriticism technique in history this is what happens to people who joke about chairman mao ripping off hillarys wardrobe
the technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union  this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during  struggle sessions  also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps 
what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided
the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed
after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line
other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form  as ive noted previously  cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes
modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that bruce jenner is actually a dude
when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things  this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus  also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors  besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal
we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood  this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for
the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth  writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems  tells an offcolor joke  or even wears the wrong tshirt  then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are
its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you
if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt  never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it
if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech
here are some other particulars to remember
you cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers  their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest
the frankfurt school  a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory  one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist
meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence  another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes 
this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status
the educational system has been dumbed down  history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve
the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children  and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt
all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part
the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others  the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique
you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power

admin,2016-10-27T16:41:44.277+03:00,college warns against deplorable and problematic costumes,"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

admin,2016-10-27T16:41:44.825+03:00,meet peter kadzik  another clinton stooge at the justice department,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

an interesting thought recently crossed my mind what would have happened if i stumbled across the manosphere in my late teens 
back when i was a bluepill high school greenhorn clueless about women and with a mind set on neutral i was destined to be just another cog in the big government machine simply put i would have been the dogs bollocks 
but having all these resources served on a silver platter would not have given me the hunger that i have for life today i would take this things as granted instead of considering every opportunity as the last one 
dwelling on those thoughts is not good what i can do is to keep writing so other young people and lost men turn their life around for the better if i must condense the most useful things i have learnt on game logistics are key

No Author,2016-10-27T17:30:23.655+03:00,glp forum godlike productions,"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

maximus is a man capital m period love truth justice liberty respect these are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west his goal for writing on rok is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink october   the sexes 
the idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west one would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the manosphere and to a great degree it is but truly the root of feminisms death was in man capital m from the very beginning one look at conan is all a man needs to know this truth 
feminism is dead the movement is absolutely dead 
the womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long theres no room for dissent its just like mean girls 
if they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction my wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced i was practically lynched for endorsing the rolling stones susan faludi is still saying im not a feminist who made her pope 
feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women you cant talk to them about anything 
 camille paglia on rob ford rihanna and rape culture for macleansca 
neurotic women indeed 
paul joseph watson of infowarsprison planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of  but he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war 
the feminist attempt to demonize normal malefemale behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month 
when you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as princess leia the queen of s patriarchal sexist misogyny to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds 
and when i say hearts and minds i mean the silent majority of young women who want nothing to do with feminism 
leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys so too will jawas darth vader and even yoda apparently that sly dude who knew 
and thats a good thing men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl this is how men and women were created and evolved you cant fight darwin and god and come out on top 
this video shows that the majority of normal women love male attention they want men to look at them they want men to notice them why 
they want a man 
i realized this is the case when i decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism  
this image from the women against feminism tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism this woman was raped she is not running around spreading lies like the uva rape hoax story that rolling stone ran and had to retract  she justs wants to go back to living a normal life she does not want to be angry at all men for the crime of one of them she does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge she does not want to be a victim feminists have lost the female youth of millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the st century 
i understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared  the problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore but that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them 
young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society 
case in point 
i met a wonderful young russian blonde a little while back twentythree tight feminine so freaking perfect we hit it off immediately on first contact having myself only traveled outside the west twice i still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time i do i am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls as i conversed with this well educated and refined young russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally i asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home 
her answer was revealing boys they completely ignore the girls dont even look at them just walk on by 
this really surprised her being a feminine russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her 
men young boys in their prime s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day 
according to wikipedia women against feminism started on tumblr in   i see womenagainstfeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society it is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage all you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect  i dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is 
as men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions the very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left  here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational

admin,2016-10-27T17:44:49.314+03:00,netflix and pill streaming firm boss reveals the future of tv could be a matrixstyle hallucinatory drug,"in a previous article  i discussed stretchingnamely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch
i am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use
how not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all
the muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving
even when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning
however if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is

relax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques
the most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to pavel tsatsouline for naming the concept
to use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and thensit and wait

yes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive
this is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion
as you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop
this technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the relax into stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation
or you can try forced relaxation where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax

either way you slice it dont just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results

admin,2016-10-27T17:44:56.416+03:00,republicans in congress are ready for hillary as they prepare for new probes into clinton foundation,"how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society 
a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture 
the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  
europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality 
in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way 
another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence 
while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed 
to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man 
further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos 
to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient 
therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men 
let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed 
an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board 
therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology 
according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children 
further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples 
consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be 
the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology 
this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples 
this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg 
romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload 
the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government 
india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  
this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context 
the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security 
this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains ½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction 
i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society 
this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins 
environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do 
considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies 
these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it 
even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dêtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers 
the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands 
in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely 
this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations 
on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution 
a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion 
our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp 
this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories 
each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy

david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   news 
you commit to treat everyoneregardless of race religion national origin ethnicity disability sex gender identity sexual orientation or agewith respect and without judgment or bias 
 airbnbs new sjw diktat 
shortterm residential accommodation network airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new nondiscrimination policy  including a requirement to accept transgender people the policy takes effect on november  and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes which airbnb says are designed to make its community more inclusive those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with airbnb 
the major problem with airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings rather than proven discrimination the overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it this rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on airbnb to generate an income it also makes it very easy for certain protected groups most notably transgender people to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination when in fact the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property 
secondly the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes or their sole investment property whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences airbnbs open doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth brian chesky mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech sjw jack dorsey of twitter 
well be implementing a new policy called open doors starting october st if a guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing having a booking canceled or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that guest a similar place to stay if one is available on airbnb or if not we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere 
 brian chesky airbnb ceo and cofounder 
in addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties another one of airbnbs new policies which is already in force treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or more strangely still alternative accommodation outside its network the second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned airbnb decide to go public it is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money 
airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it too on the one hand it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible now having providers offering  listings in  cities around the world on the other hand however it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations airbnb are mere gatekeepers providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers these same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model allegations of discrimination have been scant at best we dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates so why not airbnb providers and their guests 
various news articles reporting on the shift in airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged  let alone proven discrimination the best that sjw enablers can offer is a deeply flawed harvard study which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical africanamerican names like latoya and darnell were  percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name the harvard research leaves a lot to be desired 
moreover names like cletus and marysue would arguably garner even less approvals both these white names and the aforementioned africanamerican names usually dovetail with some of americas least sophisticated and worldly types the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home it has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought so why not with airbnb has airbnb signed its own execution order  bookingcom is better than airbnb  cheaper prices always instant booking tons of apartment listings better interface and no sjw crap

admin,2016-10-27T17:45:09.501+03:00,liberal cnn commentator blames republicans for obamacares rising premiums,"it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites

to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere
on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america
but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order
the strategy 
back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible
my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them
thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists
first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa 
second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control
no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites
on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape
on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites
so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind
conclusion is there still hope 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters
i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny

admin,2016-10-27T17:45:13.140+03:00,mission accomplished rt crew finds refugees still at jungle camp despite successful eviction,"when people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war years after starting my writing career with bang books i simply say i just wanted to get laid from these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that i find myself in today a reviewer of my new book free speech isnt free also noticed this transformation
ive been following the red pill community for a a few years now the members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net roosh is one ive only recently become familiar with as i tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like vox day dalrock and roissy
what is so fascinating about guys like roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the west find ourselves living in
this book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic red pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason i remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and i had no idea just how bad it was
i really admire the stones on this kid and i hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth which is always unpc im not a fan of lotharios but i appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery i hope rooshs neomasculinity gets legs i really do
how did game serve as the gateway drug simple i kept asking why as if i was an annoying yearold child
why are woman attracted to me when i dance and act like an entertaining clown  why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth there wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media but several steps that had to take place over the past  years my path weaved through sex and gender relations but there are other paths as well which i describe in the  paths to realizing truth  for example minimalism is another point of entry
when you live below your means you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs that leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment the easiest stepping stone out of the truman show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness and those those who chase material possessions are misguided
many other men have also had a similar path as myself whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul while not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats many do and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems i do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world because it has developed my thinking into what you read now even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure
from my current vantage point it really does feel like it was all predetermined as if i was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding but that would imply some sort of divine providence whatever the mechanism its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander more universal truth whatever individual journey youre a part of i hope well find out soon enough

this account syndicates news from other media outlets november   news 
via breitbart  
republican presidential candidate donald trump was rushed offstage at a reno nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage 
it was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or us secret service jumped down into the area where the protester was as could be seen on right side broadcasting networks video livestream of the event 
video of trump being rushed off stage was posted online 
in the video it appears trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter two us secret service agents can be seen rushing in to remove trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal 
during his absence someone announced to the crowd that trump would return the protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or secret service agents to secure the protesters removal it was several minutes before trump was able to take the stage again 
as trump returned to the stage he thanked the crowd which cheered him back

admin,2016-10-27T18:48:17.545+03:00,wikileaks email clinton operative thinks black voters are stupid,"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

admin,2016-10-27T18:55:02.206+03:00,britain joins biggest european military buildup since cold war,"many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason i have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists the usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kicking
i am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness
anecdotes perhaps youve heard of this man

that is of course jamaicas usain bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple olympic records also worth noting is that in an interview mr bolt revealed that he squats  pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen and hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellows

similarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense im using the european term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles or you can take my word for it at my best i had a one rep max squat of  pounds and had a  inch vertical leap i am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at  inches 
in fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r
anyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength
the science as i elaborated in this article  as well as in the free pdf i offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic more accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports these three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersredor slowoxidative fast glycolyticor white and fast oxidative rather than rehash an article that ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic this is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap
or to put this into terms of newtons second law of motion accelerationforcemass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate and yes i am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this
which exercises to do it is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire if you read my articles regularly you will know what i am likely to saycompound free weight lifting
in fact ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule
if you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect

similarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you through

so for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truth

many of you are probably familiar with fred on everything  a member of the old guard when it comes to the fight against feminism his hooking up article gives a birdseye view of how feminism corrupted women in a way that only a senior citizen who has seen it all can elucidate 
what i dont get is why are gals bitching this is the world they wanted they clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have they hated men because they said men werent letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to men or more likely their mothers didnt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hodcarriers and swearing like sailors finally men gave in and now women hate them for that  whatever happened to gratitude  
sally sue might have teeth like pearls and brains and perky tits and a wacky sense of humor and actually be quite a prize but sex trumps art if sally didnt say yes she knew that greta would women had commoditized themselves it was a marvelous thing for the testosterone wads we think of as college boys  
all you want is sex 
uhwhat else have you got or so what 
or marriage why would sex be better would food taste better i dont get it 
or marriage doesnt make sense do you want to eat in the same restaurant all your life 
women werent happen then and arent happy now trying to please them will just sacrifice what you want while giving no guarantee that theyll be content yet we still have beta males and white knights fighting among each other to appease the unappeasable will they collectively realize their folly 
maybe a more relevant question is if we want them to wake up when im looting the best buy after a hurricane i dont want to compete with other looters its possible the quality of goods id be able to steal would be much less due to the competition",english,prisonplanet.com,http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,whistleblowers former cia agents story,merit taking cynical view life observations cynicism realistic brave observations human nature freed sentimentality somber commentary offered one loser game life taking solace weakness failure compelling arguments either way disputed however françois de la rouchefoucauld one brilliantly cynical epigrammers ever lived probably help came long line noblemen nothing enfeebles soul much inherited wealth titles born inherited title duke death father receiving usual education class dabbled military matters teens various itinerant love affairs followed wellplaced women ended badly find imprisoned bastille week political intrigue although married continued pursue women custom time station marriages days business affairs ignored partys pleasure necessity one dalliance resulted illegitimate child woman eventually rejected appealing competitor found mixed quasirevolt called fronde adventure left impaired sight struck musket ball head health problems also intervened add misery form gout melancholy late seventeenth century france paris salons centers debate discussion flowering controversial ideas la rochefoucauld acquired acrid talent stinging prose knew use failures love war primed spirit cynical view life predilection meshed well taste salons savage wit nothing shallow sophistication frequent visits salon mme de sable paris begun piece together body epigrams represented worldview one peers commercial goals mind bootleg collection sayings first published without permission attribution two years later finally put proper edition contained maxims volume titled sentences et maximes morales usually shortened maxims philosophy centers around idea men selfseeking egoists fault virtue man displays smokescreen concealing selflove virtues vices disguise human vanity takes precedence nearly else virtues lost selfinterest rivers sea even nobler emotions like love altruism according la rochefoucauld kind traffic selflove ever proposes gainer took dim view women finding fit love men course procreation one crueler maxims womens worth lasts longer beauty lifes realities eventually caught softening rougher edges wife cared infirmities eighteen years died mothers death followed two years later two sons would eventually die injuries received frances ruinous wars period gloomy picture brightened entry life mme de la fayette twenty years junior invited stay paris carried difficulty seems viewed reform project would later say gave understanding reformed heart perhaps fame made interesting captive union worked seemed alleviate dark picture humanity final hours came asked received last rites church fair assessment la rochefoucauld must take account undeniable wit probing sensitivity ability strip away pretenses behind many human actions yet maxims meager result many superficial shallow product personality still nursing wounds early disillusionment weary aphorisms two three pages hesitate reopen book later worse still wrong say virtue altruism shams nothing vital life see around us every day know look long senses blinded fear timor animi auribus officit sallust says fear blocks ears bitter weakling cynic takes depth character accept worldsand mansfaults foibles balance mans unquestioned capacity greatness soul broader life experiences might corrected la rochefoucaulds errors preferred remain state arrested development receiving applause notoriety paris society maxims bring smiles faces easy find amusement flaws others yet forget barbs directed us well montaigne far wiser took balanced view life accepting worlds absurdities joys equanimity calm resolution greek roman sage also better man la rochefoucauld intelligent without wise never found confidence submit ego consolatory power higher philosophical authority form cynicism end strips man important protective armor leaves naked face cruelties life cynic ever died happy man read tips get best shape life,0

jeanbatave is a martial artist from the viking stronghold of normandy france he travels the world looking for new fighting techniques and new beautiful women eastern europe taught him everything he knows and is his second home his column runs every thursday november   news 
the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners 
i will let you be the own judge of the conclusions inspired by those images my father is a very cartesian fellow and a saying of his comes to mind 
just like saint thomas 
i only believe in what i see 
and what i see unsettles me",english,redstatewatcher.com,http://noiimages.s3.amazonaws.com/images/redstate/201610311934248128.jpg,hate,Real,communist brainwashing method exported united states,favorite trope feminists women claiming workplace discrimination female staff victims sexism due judgments appearance many times seen girls working building lunch breaks attire befitting tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint even gym meanwhile men must keep fashion within narrow range acceptability otherwise risk failing get fancy new job could lose current one furthermore guys learn deal fact world judge based appearance many women zero idea concept accepting judgments agree ones interests career opinions dont like always conveniently claim person giving sexist misogynist amorphously objectifying woman classic attentionseeking attentionwhore jayde phoenix epitome growing female narcissism british woman name jayde phoenix touting security expert despite academic job credentials fraction means highly qualified plain nonexistent suggested guess number usbs jar competition promote company breasts nearly spilling seethrough top looked camera lustful gaze many roosh v forum would call thousand cock stare clothes demeanor better suited street hooker professional expected troubled times many critics phoenixs contrived appearance labeled sexists bullies misogynists tried excoriate detractors emphasizing good job professional standards supposedly meets every day questions original photo exercise subsequent justifications failed answer namely shes good job need use seethrough bra picture doesnt wear top size comfortably contains breasts rather flaunting someone else photo though attentionseeking jayde employer first flared several months ago dilemma girls like ongoing one try getting employed office man sort attire baggy pants underwear showing male office worker could wearing black pants jeans like photo sporting typical business shirt doesnt matter white collar company worth dime going hire man whose boxers briefs showing ass compare parade female office workers go beyond showing arms hint bra strap exhibiting half surface area breasts addition havent already noticed short crop top staple garment within american office unculture unusual see large part womans bare stomach back including overthetop tattoos hawaiian shirts board shorts workplaces notably trying appear hip drastically relaxed need business attire employers definitely minority man penchant hawaiian shirts board shirts beach clothing find career options drastically limited way relate friends fellow tourists holiday almost always far different deal clients investors stakeholders like profession men save best worst hawaiian shirt office charity fundraising days company summer parties related functions average day leather lycra ridiculously tight clothing general inasmuch tight clothing men doesnt tickle fancy ironic obese woman wear garments twice thrice closefitting workplace fit male male office workers world dont even consider wearing leather pants next boardroom presentation occasional gay man metrosexual might escape sanction outlandish garish outfit industries value reputation clients prohibit donning clothing looks like came wardrobe lance armstrong someone queer eye straight guy excuses female attentionseeking control seems lady victoria hervey jayde phoenix read book little doubt jayde phoenixs employer expected backlash sense good marketing advertising ploy prospective clients care actual professionalism many phoenix women like situation winwin least ilk continue daytoday objectification generating desperately craved male attention particular even girls receive publics spotlight roadblock mishap career later blamed misogyny judgments appearance best happened phoenixs situation gets nationwide even global coverage narcissistic girls take zero responsibility others may negatively perceive coup lifetime yet age jayde phoenix looks far older early expect antics become strawclutching girls engage sexual selfadvancement wage war imaginary discriminations vast majority male employees scapegoat use rationalize failures virtually means combating institutionalized prejudice socalled privilege way jayde phoenixs arabic necklace indicative work may done dubai read types photos girls use attention whore tinder,0

the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience

ousted chairman of tata sons cyrus mistry today joined the aam aadmi party speaking to the media cyrus mistry said the media government regulators or politicians no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice i have faced kejriwalji is my only hope so i joined the aap 
speaking at the occasion aap supremo and delhi cm arvind kejriwal said having worked at tata steel several years ago i have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of tata sons did not allow me to work that is the reason i quit tata steel 
just like cyrus mistry i also took up the top job in delhi because there were no other suitable candidate i empathize with cyrus mistry when he says that ratan tata did not allow him to do work in a similar way narendra modi and najeeb jung do not allow me to do work in delhi he added 
why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making uk steel business first take care of indians before subsidizing british citizens ratan tata is a british agent even aap does not fire its leaders so fast he declared 
meanwhile our correspondent overheard this discussion between cyrus mistry and rajdeep sardesai 
rajdeep sardesai so what i understand mr mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in india 
cyrus mistry no i only said that i am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in tata sons against minority shareholders like me 
meanwhile aap leader ashutosh took to twitter to blast tata sons 
as per cyrus mistry tata motors nano plant in gujarat is making losses even industrialists in gujarat are losing money is this the gujarat model will modi answer he tweeted 
cyrus mistry spoke about risk of impairment in tata steal will ratan tata answer read his second tweet 
why was cyrus mistry not given a free hand to run tata suns will the bored answer said his third tweet 
a source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that tata sons is also planning to fire cyrus mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement 
after ratan tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind a consultant suggested the name of justice katju but ratan tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal instead congress leader ahmed patel will be filling this post 
according to our source the tata sons board was very impressed with ahmed patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing they should have kept planting stories in the media like ratan tata unhappy with cyrus mistrys decision to close down tata steel uk business 
this along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional ceo without letting him drift from the groups ethos and culture earned him a board seat 
further according to our source several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new chairman ahmed patel suggested the name of dr manmohan singh but ratan tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the tata group 
currently there are  persons who are frontrunners in the race for chairman one is arvind kejriwal several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board 
another name doing the round is chetan bhagat given his iit iim qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author columnist screenwriter television personality and motivational speaker several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate further he is good with numbers an area the tata group is struggling at this point in time",english,shiftfrequency.com,http://www.shiftfrequency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/StoneWaterSkyTree1-125x70.jpg,bs,Fake,november message archangel michael,gordon duff senior editor october radio host trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us editors note insanity hit trump mouthpiece arch zionist alex jones warpath jewish mob israels newspapers shocked see trump grandson brothel owner son slum lord grew meyer lanskys mobrun new york became ingenuemoney boy jewish mob kingpin roy cohn roy cohn jewish mob built trumps empire ran interference gambinos john gotti company covering seems really important article published todays jerusalem post word true moreover obvious deflection piece written save trumps nazi supporters backing face vts slam dunk assertions trumps zionist fanaticism trump pushed war iran clearing west bank one state solution israel palestinians going chimneys americas jew haters human filth would gas americas jews big trump lovers comes nazi movement largely begun fundraiser adljdlaipacsplc lobby see swastikas painted synagogues big corporate donations alex jones brother nathaniel long accused rabid antizionist controversy alex bullhorn jones alleged zionist shill expanded apparent zionistjewish connections personal staff website advertisers link time warner president edgar bronfman jr jones seeming allegiance zionism explains virtually never targets zionist jews racist zionist rogue state israel engaging notorious rants attacks may well stem protestantzionist belief system widely circulated reports wife jew makes two children jewish talmudic law eligible israeli law return additional information jones site providing alex jones zionist connections prompting reticence expose global zionism becomes ever obvious trump played hate card day one building base hatred blacksafrican americans messicans course played terror card yellow hordes card elite liberal card well one aimed jews trump whose empire built roy cohn supported financed jewish organized crime vegas boss shelly adelson buy sell trump trump change always front jewish mob jewish mobsters oft pointed ian greenhalgh surrounded trump embarrassed imagine years ago nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner alex jones tracked jones backing jewish mob bronfman crime family accused complicity financing see zionist press pulling antisemite card alex jones one israels strongest supporters us joke course kind childishness would work brain dead jew hating nazis flocked trump trumps effusive love everything israel everything zionist one might ask nazis flock nazis never thinkers great followers even sent cliff like lemmings comment boards vt inundated paid trolls track back israel others employed trump surrogate operations tied campaign toads trolls get comment placed even wrong articles thus closed comments cut income source clean trash even though best money trump pays except hookers american jews going rise knees hit back well israel adl rising tide naziism us paid donations read doesnt laughing sorry humor find humor best g,1

everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday scroll down for video below 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month more wikileaks has activated contingency plans after assange s internet link was intentionally cut off httpstcooctsmseme 
 rt rt_com october   
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters we were fastest on podestaemails  faster than wikileaks  and the us conspiracy machine cant handle it httpstconjaaeqdd 
 rt rt_com october   
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said 
assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing what in their mind is white trash",english,shiftfrequency.com,http://www.shiftfrequency.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ronnaherman.jpg,bs,Fake,fbi folds comey announces criminal charges hillary clinton,us airstrikes iraqi army slowing advance mosul gpd general posting department whereby share posts sources along general information readers managed editorial board time fbi director comey go gpd october idiot pad either way comey goand right prison dupe idiot another hoover wannabe paul callan says fbi director foolishly making public announcement agency reviewing newly discovered emails related hillary clintons personal server inserted yet campaign says clumsy handling probe reason comey resign truth investigations open close routinely secretly new evidence comes light new scrap pile useful useless evidence announced real time like scandal scripted reality tv show perhaps time embattled fbi director seems forgotten conduct proper investigation resign paul callan cnn legal analyst former nyc homicide prosecutor currently counsel new york law firm edelman edelman pc focusing wrongful conviction civil rights cases follow paulcallan cnn donald trumps oftrepeated claim fbis investigation crooked hillary presidential election rigged seems thrown fbi director james comey state panic foolishly making public announcement bureau reviewing newly discovered emails related hillary clintons personal server inserted yet presidential campaign fbi virtually never announces commencement termination ongoing criminal investigations discovery new evidence inquiries often conducted relative secrecy enabling efficient investigation old sensible fbi rule book apparently thrown trash heap year read cnn related posts,1
Gillian,2016-11-06T21:09:00.000+02:00,november message from archangel michael,"its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install hillary clinton in the white house regardless of the true vote count 
via truthandaction 

it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look 


elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve
all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant
a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a clinton victory
a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a hillary clinton victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring hillary
political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with hillary clinton securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote
the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations
its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained
even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election
in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported
election fraud expert bev harris was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving
you need to have votes counted as fractions harris said on the alex jones show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden
vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes
theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it harris pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for hillary that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people

et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la

brics plantan cara la guerra financiera de estados unidos por ariel noyola rodríguez para hacer frente la guerra financiera de estados unidos es urgente que los brics fortalezcan sus vínculos de cooperación en los ámbitos de la economía las finanzas el nuevo banco de desarrollo de los brics debe aumentar su volumen de créditos lo mismo el acuerdo contingente de reservas adicionalmente los brics deben poner en marcha lo más pronto posible su propia agencia de calificación para intensificar su cohesión económica la implementación de un área de libre comercio echaría abajo las barreras arancelarias con ello incrementaría sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos en definitiva si se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el próximo huracán financiero red voltaire ciudad de méxico méxico de octubre de français ??????? italiano el de octubre se llevó cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrónimo de brasil rusia india china sudáfrica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez más su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración frente esta difícil coyuntura hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos por más de millones de dólares para se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los millones de dólares asimismo esta entidad financiera llevó cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente millones de dólares estos títulos financieros la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglés dotado de millones de dólares ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones de forma simultánea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial solamente través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi finales de la década de los por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene través de fitch moodys standard poors estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia venezuela la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del al china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan la carga ariel noyola rodríguez fuente russia today rusia,1
Gillian,2016-11-07T15:14:04.731+02:00,get ready for a likely market crash after election video w transcript,"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

trump who according to one recent poll has a narrow lead in florida told supporters that he was confident of victory 
in  days we are going to win the state of florida and we are going to win back the white house he declared
we have a thing going on that they have never seen before it is a movement they have never seen anything like it before we are going to win and we are going to bring back a lot of good things including common sense to the white house trump added

K,2016-11-17T06:01:00.000+02:00,re why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money,"republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president
coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington dc built in the citys historic old post office building
under budget and ahead of schedule so important we dont hear those words so often but you will said trump  linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country

the united states is great he said its great its people are great there is no task or project too great there is no dream outside of our reach dont ever let anyone tell you it cant be done the future lies with the dreamers not the cynics and the critics
 
the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction

Ronald Nelson,2016-11-02T11:26:36.532+02:00,comment on nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails  fbi can access them any time by ronald nelson,"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

Mike Rivero,2016-11-19T19:07:55.594+02:00,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much

Mike Rivero,2016-11-19T23:33:00.000+02:00,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch
