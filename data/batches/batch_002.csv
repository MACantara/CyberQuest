Fed Up,2016-11-04T19:40:00.000+02:00,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

propaganda front of the criminal clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open fair and free elections in americacnn commentator donna brazile who is now the chair of the democratic national committee was caught again passing debate questions from the network to the clinton campaign during the democratic primary reports breitbartcom dirty donna brazile was caught so blatantly that even cnn had to fire her to create the appearance that cnn is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism funneling town hall and debate questions to hillary clinton days before the events the daily caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by dirty donna brazile on behalf of the corrupt criminalminded clintons donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday showthe email threads also show that brazile a former cnn contributor revealed to the clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of clinton at a march  town hall

intimidate their way to power election after election they live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood sweat and tears of the american middle class who are barely staying afloat while washington elitists like brazile abedin and clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the hunger games but its not president snow we have to worry about in the real world its the haunting possibility of a president clinton why we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on november th and once thats accomplished we must petition president trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the hundreds of seditious traitors inside the clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across americathere are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life they are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society they are sociopaths liars cheats and even murderers they are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weakminded ie democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for hillary  if we dont stop them now they threaten to turn america into a fourth reich  complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the clinton regimethese democrats like dirty donna brazile want to run america like haiti  complete with all the corruption bribery scandals and economic collapse that third world countries routinely sufferbut filthy scumbags like brazile are about to find out something rather shocking we the people wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal  we will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the us armed forces depose you and remove you from office  to announce new elections without the festering cancerous stench of the dnc and the clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filthwe the people have had enough of you demons you creatures from hell you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in washington your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end and you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom  racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of  more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton  followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary clinton and her criminal cohorts sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them  health ranger approved aquatru water filter back in stock

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:13:31.635+03:00,dr duke and dr macdonald call for prosecution of hillary for treasonous support of isis,"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,Real,dr duke dr macdonald call prosecution hillary treasonous support isis,could steal election trump even announced winner next

clinton said 
hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little 
hillary clinton is in a great position but judging from her own remarks she is still working hard to close the deal on november

sunday october   by j d heyes tags shrimp imports  chemical injections  food fraud naturalnews it seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes the less we learn about what is and isnt good for our bodies thats the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our healththe uks daily mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gellike substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exportedthe video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns shrimp in the head tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are soldvietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countriesthe video footage was shot by a vietnamese television station earlier this year since surfacing it has gone viral online on social media sites like facebook with many people expressing disgust and outragethe substance is often used in food as a thickening agent in particular for icing but many people who have watched the video are labeling the vietnamese factory and its workers as shameless and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty in addition the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products not just in vietnam but throughout the region all local shrimp suppliers do this environmental protection organization greenpeace recently released a report titled dodgy prawns as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems or that utilize toxic chemicalsthe guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around australia but also ecologically certified black tiger prawns from vietnam the organization also warned against all imported vannamei which very often is sourced from vietnam because of concern about mangrove destruction pollution and the use of invasive species natural blaze  in reporting on the story  noted that workers at the vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because all local shrimp suppliers do thisthe site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries including china which has a welldeserved reputation for unclean unsanitary food productionin the us about  million pounds of shrimp  or about  percent of the amount of shrimp americans consume annually  comes from vietnam which in turn gets most of its shrimp from china where food regulation is a cruel joke added weight means additional profits natural blaze reported that after about  million worth of shrimp was imported into the us from china between january and october  the us food and drug administration issued an import alert in december of that year the alert warned importers of the presence of new animals drugs andor unsafe food additives in seafood originating in china and that included shrimpthe daily mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as carboxymethyl cellulose or cmc many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the shrimpbut obviously cmc is not a naturallyoccurring element either which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural  and the substance has been linked to diarrhea abdominal cramps eye pain and irritation and lingering changes in vision natural blaze notedand yet its use in food continues thats because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight and even if retailers arent doing the injecting they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source

Henry Wolff,2016-11-08T05:20:41.889+02:00,why american surrogates are in demand for chinese families,"world wildlife falls by  in  years  
bbc news global wildlife populations have fallen by  since  a report says 
the living planet assessment by the zoological society of london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  
the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses 
human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines 
dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on 
we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act 
however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years 
the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife 
for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf 
this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world 
the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos 
any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study 
the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time 
some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture 
the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years 
this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  
dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others 
we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example 
it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing 
if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl 
the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade 
dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse 
but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates 
however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university 
stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news 
for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe 
when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean 
theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed 
but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world 
its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data 
were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline 
its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,american surrogates demand chinese families,world wildlife falls years bbc news global wildlife populations fallen since report says living planet assessment zoological society london zsl wwf suggests trend continues decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates figures suggest animals living lakes rivers wetlands suffering biggest losses human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution climate change contributed declines dr mike barrett head science policy wwf said pretty clear business usual see continued declines wildlife populations think weve reached point isnt really excuse let carry know causes know scale impact humans nature wildlife populations really us act however methodology report criticised image copyright carlos drews wwf image caption report looked data collected species vertebrates last years living planet report published every two years aims provide assessment state worlds wildlife freshwater species alone decline stands since dr mike barrett wwf analysis looked different species birds fish mammals amphibians reptiles total number vertebrate species world team collected data peerreviewed studies government statistics surveys collated conservation groups ngos species population data going back two time points show trends included study researchers analysed population sizes changed time information weighted take account groups animals great deal data many records arctic near arctic birds example little data tropical amphibians example report authors said make sure surplus information declines animals skew overall picture last report published estimated worlds wildlife populations halved last years assessment suggests trend continued since populations declined average dr barrett said groups animals fared worse others see particularly strong declines freshwater environment freshwater species alone decline stands since related way water used taken fresh water systems also fragmentation freshwater systems dam building example also highlighted species african elephants suffered huge declines recent years increase poaching sharks threatened overfishing pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse dr robin freeman zsl researchers conclude vertebrate populations declining average year warn nothing done wildlife populations could fall levels end decade dr robin freeman head zsls indicators assessments unit said thats assuming things continue expect pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse one things think important stats trends declines number animals wildlife populations extinctions large vanishing presents us opportunity something image copyright scott dickerson image caption still many gaps knowledge worlds vertebrates however living planet reports drawn criticisms numbers report sensible numbers sketchy stuart pimm duke university stuart pimm professor conservation ecology duke university united states said wildlife decline many gaps data boil population loss single figure numbers report sensible numbers sketchy told bbc news example look data comes surprisingly massively skewed towards western europe go elsewhere data become far fewer practice become much much sketchier almost nothing south america tropical africa much tropics period time trying mix stuff like hard know numbers mean theyre trying pull stuff blender spew single number flawed dr freeman said team taken best data possible around world completely true regions groups like tropical amphibians example lack data thats lack data confident method using best method present overall estimate population decline entirely possible species arent monitored effectively may much worse id surprised much better observed,1

tuesday november   by j d heyes tags china  organ harvesting  political prisoners naturalnews in the us these days supporting gop presidential nominee donald j trump will earn you an assault from leftwing cowards and bullies who support democratic nominee hillary clinton  but in china being a political dissident and opposing the ruling communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating roomwhere youll have your organs removed for waiting transplant touristsas reported by the epoch times  chinese officials began persecuting the  million practitioners of falun gong in july  and have continued to do so ever since to the chinese communists there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulnessnot long ago this kind of treatment of chinese dissidents would draw loud rebukes from the us government the united nations and various human rights organizations around the world as well as major media coverage but since the chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the worlds advanced countries outrage has been mutedthe lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the chinese communists a green light to treat falun gong  and anyone else deemed a political dissident  in any barbaric way they choose a new form of evil hence the creation of a cottage industry of sorts  transplant tourism as the epoch times noted this is essentially  murder on demand  for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to china for a transplant operation it is a huge source of revenue both for the chinese military and for private hospitals around the country according to nobel prize nominees and investigators david matas an international human rights attorney and david kilgour a former canadian foreign secretary for asiapacificmatas and kilgour published their first investigative report in   and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in china from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since the investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience primarily followers of falun gong  the largest group in chinas prisonsin their  report matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from falun gong adherents by the chinese communist party as a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planetone of the founding board members of doctors against forced organ harvesting dafoh dr dana churchill spoke at rallies in los angeles and santa monica beach earlier this month she said that to this point the world had never witnessed a more horrific and barbaric crime as the chinese communist party has committed against falun gong crime against humanity she added that it wasnt just falun gong adherents who were being victimized however others include christians the uyghurs and tibetans all of whom have also had their organs harvested while they are alive unwilling and between  and  years

washington dc rally on july   following nine years of investigation the world organization to investigate the persecution of falun gong announced that it had concluded that since july   the chinese communist party ccp lead by its former head jiang zemin has utilized chinas entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living falun gong practitioners as a way to physically destroy the group as a

wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to save america and expose the criminal politicians bring out the marshmallows and weiners folks this is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to us history that anyone has witnessed in over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get and thank god hillary doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes or shed probably launch them just to change the narrativeas for me im with anybody whos trying to save america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in washington dc who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised the revolution is on anonymous wikileaks project veritas the fbi and the nsa have all been activated theres no stopping them now and all the details of all the crimes of the clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history dirty deeds and allbe warned you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the clintons really are you will probably vomit health ranger approved aquatru water filter back in stock
