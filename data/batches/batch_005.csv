Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:01:11.700+03:00,clinton policy on syria would lead to ww iii trump,"clintons nofly zone over syria will lead to war with russia warning of jcs chairman general dunford october   at  am global research  october   the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation 
in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi 
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives 
i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace 
this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added 
at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone 
the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense 
under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed 
michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option 
according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region 
confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces 
according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit
since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington 
flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone 
the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything
senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing 
what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage 
secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything 
senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  
secretary carter well okay 
senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms 
secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me 
senator wicker im speaking about a  
secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing 
let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add 
general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president 
senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped 
general dunford all options  
senator wicker what do you think of that option sir 
general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make 

concluding remarks 
from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation 
it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  
consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country 
the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original

Shawn Helton,2016-11-04T00:03:00.000+02:00,partners in crime goldman sachs the clintons  wall street,"st century wire says 
this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation 
ja yes

william mcgurn wall street journal 
lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains

admin,2016-10-27T13:58:44.202+03:00,get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

Staff,2016-11-15T01:37:13.686+02:00,david duke on cnn," views share 
dr david duke offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society 
a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars 
in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom 
i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent 
human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself 
not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale 
much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural 
human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth 
we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind 
we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit 
for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence 
nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions 
we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society 
if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite 
it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this 
we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all 
instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony 
we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people 
and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states 
look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom 
a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord 
just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity 
every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings 
this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict 
in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  
they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide 
better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect 
it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts 
it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity 
we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity 
we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity 
as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity 
this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened 
but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals 
i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine 
i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself 
there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself 
but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all 
in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity 
nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony 
it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast 
group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents 
although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony 
and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots 
this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression 
autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric 
nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people 
even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning 
when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic 
they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity 
contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict 
how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity 
so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values 
and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities 
there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants 
but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population 
this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority 
a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics 
the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit 
it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism 
the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth 
they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills 
they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt 
they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation 
and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people 
they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism 
globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence 
but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism 
we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence 
we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda 
we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars 
we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite 
we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity 
we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity 
whether we are kurds or pakistanis or iranians or palestinians whether we are chinese or japanese or africans or indians or of european heritage we say no to globalism 
we say yes to human freedom and global diversity we say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny 
we say no to the global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power we say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth 
we are humanity we are many 
because we honor our own heritage and traditions we honor every heritage and tradition 
because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on earth 
because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s 
just as most europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures we refuse to support the globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world 
because we love peace we refuse to support their zionistdriven globalist wars a new paradigm of human rights 
this is a new affirmation of human rights a new paradigm it is the human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom 
it is found where people yearn for human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in nature 
the globalists have global economic media political and military power but we represent the true desires of humanity for freedom 
we represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions human diversity freedom and independence 
we must resist rule of the globalists over us with a global coalition of mutually free peoples 
we are rising in every nation 
our paradigm for human freedom and diversity is growing among people all over the world 
the globalists cannot rule over us without our consent they cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of human freedom and diversity not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all mankind good for all people on this planet 
the principles we stand for we hold for our own people and for every people on the face the earth 
this is the world i am committed to the humanity i am committed to the nation in my own land that i am committed to 
i hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for humanity a new commitment to human freedom and diversity

snip according to misao dean professor of english at the university of victoria the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism imperialism and genocide due to history she also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society 
in a radio interview for cbc radio  which wasnt picked up by the internet until several months later she claimed we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol something that seems natural that seems ordinary and seems to promote values that we ascribe to 
but i think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrativeand that narrative is about to be blunt its about theft and genocide the professor said 
snip 
its not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age    certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society theyre frequently highly educated people theyre almost completely white she said 
cbc radio host jim brown then asked a question should we look at the canoe as a noncontroversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism 
to which the academic replied absolutely a symbol of colonialism it seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the canadian government and canadians in general did to first nations people

grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive

creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown
