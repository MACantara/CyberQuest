the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business 
the global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire all of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system money is necessary for our survival in the real world today most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system if money is the god of our time that makes rothschild his prophet public school programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds they continue the shaping through the media we are taught what they want us to know and nothing more 
the rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses when the top  percent owns the majority of banks resources and even our governments it means big problems for the people the rothschilds are worth over  trillion and they are just  of  families that pretty much collectively own the world the rothschilds alone could pay off the us national debt  times over unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks the new world orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources

sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer naturalnews inexpensive nontoxic versatile and potent hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every homehydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes but many people dont understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached in this unstable form the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive but once it has reacted the only byproducts are nonreactive oxygen and water this is why when used properly hydrogen peroxide is so safehydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria viruses yeast and parasites in this context it also appears to act as an antiinflammatory natural remedies so how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you unsurprisingly many of this products greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other healthpromoting function for example a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of  percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of nonchlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the same mouthwash can also remove bad breathif you think youre coming down with a cold stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morninghydrogen peroxide is also a potent antifungal a  mix of hydrogen peroxide and water sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry is a good way to get rid of athletes foot and other fungal infections a similar but much more diluted cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus in this case dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant replace your cosmetics you can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home mixed with baking soda it makes a great toothpaste it can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while such as that in a humidifier or steamer  a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth similarly you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner let it sit for  minutes and then scrubwhen properly diluted hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins just mix  quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or moreother cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses  it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses  or helping to remove ear wax buildup a few drops in the ears followed by a few drops of olive oil will cause earwax to break up and drain outhydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair household uses hydrogen peroxide isnt just for your body it can also be for your dogs hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects vomiting should only be induced upon a vets recommendation howeverfinally hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry more carefully applied it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration this is particularly effective with blooduse caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics but if you have a fresh organic stain you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide wait a few minutes it should foam and then rinse it off with cold water and soap sources for this article
