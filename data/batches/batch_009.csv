friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki

  clinton corruption  john podesta  crime family naturalnews its not just that the corruption and criminality of the clintons knows no bounds its also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy truth and ethics their mission put our nations worst political criminal into the white house by any means necessary including systematic lying fraud money laundering intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her the clinton machine is a mafia operation  and every person involved in it must go to jailthat includes not just the deep operatives like podesta lynch and abedin but also all the deep cover clinton operatives pretending to be journalists  including stephanopoulos maddow hayes milbank and all the rest  see the list here  every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the united states of america and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy steal the election and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind barsa former fbi official said sunday that bill and hillary clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into hillary clintons private email server while she was secretary of state reports thehillcom  kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liarhe also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private serverthe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything richard nixon ever attempted corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat trump while all this is happening the corrupt leftist media  washington post new york times msnbc cnn google news yahoo news etc  has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now allin for the clinton criminal mafiathey have

change the channels or turn off their cable tv altogether who needs politicized espn anyway to seek out more accurate news online from sites like natural news and breitbartcom even the mass censorship

Heyes,2016-11-02T07:13:24.325+02:00,this smart harmless pesticide patent could take down monsanto and change the world,"a complaint has been filed against fbi director james comey with department of justice office of professional responsibility that accuses him of interfering in a presidential election 
the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act 
what republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy 
the american people deserve a full explanation from director comey because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers",english,naturalnews.com,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Drink/Water-Pitcher-Lemons.jpg,conspiracy,Fake,associated press reporter admits faking news stories hillary clinton stunning admission reveals ap prints whatever clintons want facts damned,sarah jones fri oct th pm matthew miller self described recovering flack doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey violating power lambasted commenting case within days election share twitter print post former doj spokesman eric holder matthew miller self described recovering flack doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey violating power lambasted commenting case within days election department fbi strict rules comment ongoing cases director comey violated rules going back original press conference closed case miller said cnn latest example violates long standing practice department goes way anything seen trying influence election closing days election usually interpret closing days seen last days let alone last days watch miller also held school twitter comeys abuse power led hillary clinton defend negative wrote piece july comeys public comments clinton inappropriate abuse power httpstcogcrozqwz matthew miller matthewamiller october flagrantly violated doj rules press conference went break new ground discussing details case congress matthew miller matthewamiller october followed quickly releasing fbi something rarely doubt future highprofile cases matthew miller matthewamiller october time either violated seriously stretched doj rule precedent press conference original sin begat rest matthew miller matthewamiller october todays disclosure might worst abuse yet doj goes way avoid publicly discussing investigations close election matthew miller matthewamiller october public discussion either often wont send subpoenas take steps might leak election matthew miller matthewamiller october voters way interpret fbidoj activity neutral way target investigation conduct matthew miller matthewamiller october might totally benign even involve clinton way press voters know easy opponent make hay matthew miller matthewamiller october takes us back original rule dont comment ongoing investigations multiply times ten close election matthew miller matthewamiller october whatever reason many theories comey continues ignore clinton matthew miller matthewamiller october fbi undoubtedly investigating links russian hack manafort trump campaign arent commenting good matthew miller matthewamiller october miller points smells worse worse learn linking emails clinton appeared like info fbi already wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi ken gude kengude october problem comeys actions isnt investigating hillary clinton problem violating long standing rules prohibit federal employees anything could seen political near election established rule ongoing investigations arent commented obvious reasons quite simply done comeys reasons unclear perhaps provides information decision make sense troubling seeing consistent breakdown tradition rulesagreements law surrounding trump campaign seems lowered bar around fbi director james comey schooled former doj spokesman abusing power added sarah jones fri oct th,1

tuesday november   by ethan a huff staff writer tags jimmy johns  endangered species  trophy hunting naturalnews the owner of the american fast food chain jimmy johns is under fire after photos emerged of him smiling and giving a thumbs up beside numerous endangered species that hes hunted and killed throughout africa over the years for seemingly no other purpose than simply to invoke death for pleasurereports indicate that jimmy john liautaud has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per hunting trip to gain access to these precious species including one particular trophy hunt in which he spent a whopping  just to kill an extremely endangered female black rhino graphic photos of liautaud with this rhino and other animals are available here  but be warned these images are horrifyingly upsettingliautauds trophy hunts are apparently a routine pastime of his just as they are for the many other bored millionaires out there with too much time and money on their hands who seem to get a kick out of taking out the rarest animals on our planet  beautiful creatures like leopards rhinos lions and even elephants which have the largest brains of any land animals its the type of thing that if more people knew about it theyd likely stop eating at jimmy johns altogethermr jimmy johns poaching fetish has been making the media rounds and many are now calling on a national boycott of the sandwich chain which has already been exposed for underpaying its employees and treating them like slave workers the wall street journal wsj reported that social media users had attempted to launch a boycott of jimmy johns using the boycottjimmyjohns hashtag on twitter though the company didnt seem all that phasedstill the issue hasnt gone away and many in the public remain outraged over what they say is reckless and reprehensible behavior not only is liautaud killing these rare and exotic animals in cold blood but hes doing so in such an utterly cruel way that even the most avid hunters would be hardpressed not to cringe or perhaps shed a few tearsusually the animals are lured from a national park on to private property lara starr investigative writer and cofounder of the earth child writes noting that this is not the method liautaud uses to kill his prey trophy hunters will leave out bait play the sounds of other animals to lure them in or a few other tactics to find their animal victimscanned hunting is even worse she adds it is the shooting fish in a barrel version of trophy hunting  the animals are often hand raised so they are tame and dont run away they leave food out for them one day then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle sometimes they dont even have to creep sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck then go back to drinking their gin  tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun trophy hunting costs do not help repopulate endangered animal species one of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies plains and jungles with endangered species but this isnt actually true as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposesnontrophy hunting tourism on the other hand is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations  up to  times than what trophy hunting contributes  according to heather callaghan editor of natural blaze  likewise the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers
