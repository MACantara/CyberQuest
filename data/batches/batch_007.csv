donald trumps message that everything in the us is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only trump can fix got slapped down today as the us economy roars back 
the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of  showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of  the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with us economy roars back grew  in third quarter 
jason furman chairman of the council of economic advisers summarized the numbers real gdp grew  percent at an annual rate in the third quarter with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix the trump economic plan creates at least  million jobs boosts growth up to  percent and is revenue neutral trumps website claims 
before these numbers trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent isnt revenue neutral and would destroy  million jobs trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run 
the conservativeleaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by  trumps tax plan could cost the us  million jobs 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections the analysis shows that if implemented the democratic nominees agenda would create  million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of  percent 
under trumps plan moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to  percent and over  million americans would be put out of work the us economy will weaken significantly if mr trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed the june report said the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early  and extends into even longer than the great recession 
yikes 
trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts trump earned a pants on fire from politifact for this claim made june th  in his presidential announcement speech the last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product  was below zero who ever heard of this its never below zero 
but also they note finally since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth well just throw this out of the  quarters of negative growth since world war ii  occurred under republican presidents and just  under democratic presidents 
todays new economic numbers help clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under president obama 
hillary for america senior policy advisor jacob leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say todays gdp release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years but hillary clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top independent experts agree her plan would create goodpaying jobs through investments in infrastructure innovation and education 
the economy is roaring back under president obama and the numbers suggest that it does better under a democratic president donald trump keeps saying clinton is  more years of obama which makes a sunny case for her 
trump is already struggling with just  days to go until the election on november th and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle reality has spoken and it doesnt agree with donald trumps vision of america",english,naturalnews.com,http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Misc/Zika-Virus-a-Hoax.jpg,junksci,Fake,end game closes clintons deep state turns massive collection criminally damning evidence revealed bring clinton crime family forever,new clinton email scandal keeps getting worse republicans new information emerging emails fbi looking server ap reporting breaking us official newly discovered emails related clinton investigation come private server previous reporting known emails nothing clinton campaign clinton foundation russian hacks state department emails sent received know emails server fbi director comey completely bungled announcement needs explain fbi analyzing doesnt sound like anything hillary clinton email scandal republicans thought would save evaporated nearly quickly arrived new development clear much less story initially reported republican party wants risk losing even house senate seats days pursuing nonstory feel free time republicans spend talking clintons emails next days help democratic party,1

Daniel Barker,2016-10-28T09:33:57.630+03:00,nongmo crop circles showing up in corn fields in nebraska,"food mixology when eaten together these foods can boost health 
  isabelle z tags nutrients  food pairings  turmeric naturalnews if you are making a conscious effort to eat nutritious food you are already stacking the odds in your favor when it comes to your health and wellbeing however eating all the organic fruits and vegetables in the world is not going to do much for you if your body is not prepared to absorb the nutrients they containto be clear eating a diet that is rich in organic produce whole grains and a reasonable amount of healthy fats is always preferable to a diet full of fried food sugar and processed foods however if you want to maximize the benefits of your smart eating choices you should try some of these food pairings to enhance nutrient absorption and give your health a boost milk and honey your grandmother might have offered you a glass of warm milk with honey when you struggled to fall asleep as a child and this triedandtrue combination has stood the test of time for good reason it is a very effective pairing for your health an amino acid found in milk known as tryptophan is used by the brain to make melatonin and serotonin while the carbohydrates in honey can help with the uptake of tryptophan turmeric and black pepper the active ingredient in turmeric curcumin has antiinflammatory properties but it tends to be poorly absorbed by the body interestingly the piperine found in black pepper can help boost its absorption significantly which is why many supplements contain both ingredients try cooking a dish that contains generous amounts of turmeric  like curry and add a sprinkling of black pepper a tiny pinch of pepper can enhance your absorption of curcumin by more than  percent green tea and lemon if you are drinking green tea for its extraordinary antioxidant content you might want to start adding some organic lemon juice to your cup thats because purdue university researchers have discovered that mixing green tea with lemon juice can significantly boost the amount of antioxidants that are available for your body to absorb the catechins in green tea can help protect your body against cancer heart disease and alzheimers disease olive oil and tomatoes these two mediterranean diet staples go hand in hand and its easy to see why tomatoes contain antioxidants that can protect your body from disease and adding a small amount of healthy fat to carotenoidrich foods like tomatoes can increase its absorption try making a simple salad of chopped tomatoes drizzled in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to reap the benefits the lycopene in tomatoes is also better absorbed when they are heated first so take this one step further and make a tomato sauce or pizza sauce by cooking tomatoes and adding olive oil and wwwherbsnews  target_blankwwwherbsnewsfresh herbs like oregano beans and cauliflower people who follow plantbased diets often rely on beans to get iron but this type of iron is not as easily absorbed by the human body as iron that comes from meat sources you can increase your bodys absorption of the iron from beans by consuming a food that is rich in vitamin c at the same time and cauliflower fits the bill quite nicely pair cauliflower with green beans or garbanzos to give your body an iron boost you can also try other iron and vitamin c pairings  like strawberries with oatmealwhile all of these foods are quite healthy on their own if you are looking to increase your intake of certain nutrients make sure you are opting for food pairings and preparation methods that will boost absorption so you can reap the most benefits

Mike Rivero,2016-11-19T23:33:00.000+02:00,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

admin,2016-10-27T18:55:02.206+03:00,britain joins biggest european military buildup since cold war,"many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason i have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists the usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kicking
i am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness
anecdotes perhaps youve heard of this man

that is of course jamaicas usain bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple olympic records also worth noting is that in an interview mr bolt revealed that he squats  pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen and hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellows

similarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense im using the european term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles or you can take my word for it at my best i had a one rep max squat of  pounds and had a  inch vertical leap i am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at  inches 
in fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r
anyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength
the science as i elaborated in this article  as well as in the free pdf i offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic more accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports these three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersredor slowoxidative fast glycolyticor white and fast oxidative rather than rehash an article that ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic this is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap
or to put this into terms of newtons second law of motion accelerationforcemass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate and yes i am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this
which exercises to do it is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire if you read my articles regularly you will know what i am likely to saycompound free weight lifting
in fact ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule
if you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect

similarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you through

so for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truth

Gillian,2016-11-07T15:14:04.731+02:00,get ready for a likely market crash after election video w transcript,"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

call it the crisis of whiteness 
white anxiety has fueled this years political tumult in the west britains surprising vote to exit the european union donald j trumps unexpected capture of the republican presidential nomination in the united states the rise of rightwing nationalism in norway hungary austria and greece 
whiteness in this context is more than just skin color you could define it as membership in the ethnonational majority but thats a mouthful what it really means is the privilege of not being defined as other 
whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance traditions religion and even food are the default norm its being a person who by unspoken rules was long entitled as part of us instead of them 
snip 
its fundamentally about who are we said eric kaufmann a professor of politics at birkbeck college university of london what does it mean to be part of this nation is it not our nation anymore our meaning the ethnic majority 
these kinds of questions are really front and center even though theyre not necessarily verbalized 
the questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism through the civil rights movement in the united states and the european unions opening up of borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in say university admissions but rising wages an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents and confident that their children would do better still 
that feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself 
but as western manufacturing and industry have declined taking many workingclass towns with them parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation 
that creates an identity vacuum to be filled 
for someone who is lower income or lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going to get more selfesteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity 
snip 
a recent gallup study found that mr trumps supporters tend to earn aboveaverage incomes for their communities but also tend to live in majoritywhite areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents 
snip 
the formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has by extension constructed a new broader national identity the united states has a black president london has a muslim mayor of pakistani descent 
but that broadening can to some feel like a painful loss articulated in the demand voiced over and over at trump rallies probrexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout europe i want my country back 
the mantra is not all about bigotry rather being part of a culture designed around peoples own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance of belonging 
the loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that robin diangelo a lecturer and author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default that whiteness is just a race like any other 
fragility leads to feelings of insecurity defensiveness even threat and it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders 
snip 
for decades the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy when that became taboo it left white identity politics without a vocabulary 
if you are a workingclass white person and you fear that the new cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis 
some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns trade crime the war on drugs controlling the borders fear of islamist terrorism all are significant in their own right and create very real fears for many people but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what societys changes mean for white majorities 
snip 
there will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity immigration cannot be halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage and the other groups who seem to be cutting in line are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them 
western whites have a place within their nations new broader national identities but unless they accept it the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,migrants pitch tents paris streets calais camp shuts,amanda taub new york times november call crisis whiteness white anxiety fueled years political tumult west britains surprising vote exit european union donald j trumps unexpected capture republican presidential nomination united states rise rightwing nationalism norway hungary austria greece whiteness context skin color could define membership ethnonational majority thats mouthful really means privilege defined whiteness means part group whose appearance traditions religion even food default norm person unspoken rules long entitled part us instead snip fundamentally said eric kaufmann professor politics birkbeck college university london mean part nation nation anymore meaning ethnic majority kinds questions really front center even though theyre necessarily verbalized questions seem like sudden reversal decades rising multiculturalism civil rights movement united states european unions opening borders snip white peoples officially privileged status waned latter half th century demise discriminatory practices say university admissions rising wages expanding social safety net new educational opportunities helped offset white adults wealthier successful parents confident children would better still feeling success may provided sort identity western manufacturing industry declined taking many workingclass towns parents grandparents found opportunities unavailable next generation creates identity vacuum filled someone lower income lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going get selfesteem communal identity ethnicity nation would sort achieved identity snip recent gallup study found mr trumps supporters tend earn aboveaverage incomes communities also tend live majoritywhite areas children likely worse parents snip formal rejection racial discrimination societies extension constructed new broader national identity united states black president london muslim mayor pakistani descent broadening feel like painful loss articulated demand voiced trump rallies probrexit events gatherings populist parties throughout europe want country back mantra bigotry rather part culture designed around peoples community customs constant background hum reassurance belonging loss comforting hum accelerated phenomenon robin diangelo lecturer author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel confront knowledge neither special default whiteness race like fragility leads feelings insecurity defensiveness even threat trigger backlash perceived outsiders snip decades language white identity existed context white supremacy became taboo left white identity politics without vocabulary workingclass white person fear new cosmopolitan world destroy diminish identity cherish culturally acceptable way articulate perceive crisis people instead reached issues feel close concerns trade crime war drugs controlling borders fear islamist terrorism significant right create real fears many people also become means public conversation societys changes mean white majorities snip likely return whiteness social dominance exclusive national identity immigration cannot halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants already arrived cannot expelled en masse without causing social moral damage groups seem cutting line fact getting chance progress long denied western whites place within nations new broader national identities unless accept crisis whiteness seems likely continue,1
Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-11-03T21:10:52.388+02:00,after debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,"david brooks whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization immigration and feminism november   at  am by dr patrick slattery 
on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school 
brooks conclusion was even more breath taking 
and shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out and therefore as a result what happened was they were alienated they got super cynical because they really were being shafted and so they react in an angry way 
well thats not a shock given the last  or  years of american history and so for us going forward its to not reverse the dynamism of american society and the diversity its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it and so this doesnt happen again 
here he admits that whites got shafted that we are being ruined by diversity but the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again what is he concerned that hispanics might be jewed out of the america they inherit from whites 
the rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against donald trump with any luck on tuesday trump will be elected president and we can make begin the process of making america america again",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,Real,debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,david brooks whites voting gene pool ruined globalization immigration feminism november dr patrick slattery pbs news hour friday david brooks said white people voting gene pool wow wow david brooks wrote new york times column jewish woman came speech knowing jewish told speech description jews taken america acknowledged column indeed caseone jewish professors boasted jews earn like episcopalians vote like puerto ricans words voted gene pool course eventually bought republican party well gave gene pools vote choice blacks famously vote gene pool hispanics expected vote gene pool whites whites alone consider ethnic interests voting something brooks rest zio elite goyish lackey find deplorable basically less educated high schooleducated whites going trump doesnt matter guy collegeeducated going clinton sometimes get sense campaign barely matters people going gene pool whatever one depressing aspects race brooks said reasons whites besides collegeindoctrinated whites voting gene pool even interesting lot good things years really good america think globalization really good america think influx immigrants really good america feminism really good america lot people used society three good things lot high schooleducated white guys displaced david brooks growing whites make close american population doesnt really make sense say displacement bulk american population good america course specify high schooleducated white guys well blacks helped globalization immigration feminism employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc white women well maybe ever wanted first place blue hair nose rings tattoos raise cats instead babies guess never asked college educated white guys well used go harvard yale affirmative action blacks hispanics competition asians massive jewish nepotism white guy lucky get secondtier state school brooks conclusion even breath taking shame us paying attention helping therefore result happened alienated got super cynical really shafted react angry way well thats shock given last years american history us going forward reverse dynamism american society diversity pay attention people ruined doesnt happen admits whites got shafted ruined diversity weird thing line doesnt happen concerned hispanics might jewed america inherit whites rest appearance poetic rant donald trump luck tuesday trump elected president make begin process making america america,1

became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of dakota access pipeline protestors pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main
