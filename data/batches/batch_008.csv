today dr duke and pastor mark dankof discuss the historic victory achieved last night although dr duke came up short amidst the most unfair and rigged system in his own bid for the us senate there is no doubt that the altright movement that propagated dr dukes narrative far and wide was decisive in donald trumps win last night 
with just enough of our people having woken up in the nick of time we can now avoid the global armageddon that hillarys zio handlers were lurching towards but there is much work to be done we need to build a wall and even more importantly repeal the  immigration act we need to build our own media so that the american voters are no longer fed lies and deceit unchallenged and most of all we need to red pill the public to the existence of jewish domination of our society so that we truly can take back our country and make america great again

imagine if during the jim crow era a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers 
thats basically what facebook is doing nowadays 
the ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls ethnic affinities ads that exclude people based on race gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment 
snip 
the ad we purchased was targeted to facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an affinity for africanamerican asianamerican or hispanic people  heres the ad itself  
when we showed facebooks racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer john relman  he gasped and said this is horrifying this is massively illegal this is about as blatant a violation of the federal fair housing act as one can find 
the fair housing act of  makes it illegal to make print or publish or cause to be made printed or published any notice statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference limitation or discrimination based on race color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines  
the civil rights act of  also prohibits the printing or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference limitation specification or discrimination in employment recruitment 
snip 
facebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination harassment disparagement or predatory advertising practices 
we take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate and they require compliance with the law said steve satterfield privacy and public policy manager at facebook we take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies 
snip 
he said facebook began offering the ethnic affinity categories within the past two years as part of a multicultural advertising effort 
satterfield added that the ethnic affinity is not the same as racewhich facebook does not ask its members about facebook assigns members an ethnic affinity based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on facebook 
when we asked why ethnic affinity was included in the demographics category of its adtargeting tool if its not a representation of demographics facebook responded that it plans to move ethnic affinity to another section 
facebook declined to answer questions about why our housing ad excluding minority groups was approved  minutes after we placed the order

thousands of angry chinese immigrants demonstrated in a paris suburb yesterday sun to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets 
the death of a yearold chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the french capital 
the chinese community is dying in silence read a slogan on a tshirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator maike song 
he said he joined the protest in aubervilliers to pay homage to chaoling zhang the father of two who died on august  after being punched to ground in the northeastern suburb that is home to some  chinese immigrants 
no arrests have been made over the attack 
about  chinese residents of aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since november according to the francochinese friendship association 
it is because of prejudices that chinese people are weak docile and wealthy said fang a young female student ive been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing some have moved away from this area because of it i dont go out with a handbag any more 
community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area generally of arab or african origin 
paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin 
many chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively welloff but are often reluctant to go to the police some victims have been illegal immigrants said dominique darden a social worker

Don Wrightman,2016-11-05T22:27:00.000+02:00,youtube censoring videos  on censorship,"by headly westerfield on fri oct th  at  pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post 
earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years 
aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park

  j d heyes naturalnews the global warmingclimate change charade is bad enough in that it is nothing more than a politically motivated issue used by globalists of all political stripes to gain more control over the worlds populationbut now its costing some citizens scarce tax dollarsas reported by the daily caller  a top university in britain has been caught stealing millions of taxpayer dollars from a federal budget that is chronically in the red just to produce phony global warming data a global warming research center at the london school of economics received millions of dollars pounds from uk taxpayers after taking credit for research it did not performthe uks daily mail noted further that the uk government provided  million  million in us dollars in funding to the centre for climate change economics and policy cccep in exchange for research that was never done massive scientific fraud regarding global warming a number of papers that cccep claimed to have published to receive government funding were not even about global warming and were written before the organization was even founded or written by researchers who were not affiliated with the center worse government officials never bothered to check ccceps alleged publication lists saying instead they were taken on trust according to a recently released reportit is serious misconduct to claim credit for a paper you havent supported and its fraud to use that in a bid to renew a grant professor richard tol a climate economics expert from sussex university whose research was reportedly stolen by cccep told the daily mail  ive never come across anything like it before it stinksthe centers chairman since  has been nick stern a wellknown global advocate for more policy action supposedly aimed at combating climate change in addition he is also the president of the british academy an invitationonly society that is reserved for the academic elite and which disburses grant money in the millions of pounds to researchers as well as lord sterns own organizationin recent days the cccep which is jointly based at the london school of economics and the university of leeds hosted a gala event that was attended by experts and officials from around the world the occasion a celebration to mark the th anniversary of the stern review a page report detailing the alleged economic impact of climate change a review that was commissioned by tony blairs governmentthe massive paper claimed that the world must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face dramatically higher costs in the future the review exerted a great amount of power and influence on a series of british governments as well as international organizationsbut now the reports contents and conclusions are in serious doubt not the first time global warming data has been faked following the daily mail s report cccep spokesman bob ward admitted the organization had made mistakes in both claiming credit for studies it did not perform and foro papers that were actually researched and published by other academicsacademics and experts whose work was falsely represented were furious including one who said ccceps actions were a clear case of fraud  using deception for financial gain the dc reportedstudies receiving financial support from the public sector are not required to disclose it as an ethical

presidentelect donald trumps appointment of bannon flynn and sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking america back 
trump chief strategist bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on white people on his breitbart website 
national security head flynn realizes that americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical jihadists of saudi arabia over our natural allies the christian muslim and moderate secularists of syria he also understands that putin of christian russia should not be our enemy but our ally he is an avowed enemy of the jewish warmonger traitors called neocons and they in turn intensely hate this us army general who truly puts america first 
attorney general sessions has been hated for years by the jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into america and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action 
during his us senate confirmation hearings senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created america 
we must demand the protection of the civil rights of all americans including white people everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive antiwhite affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations federal state and city governments colleges and educational institutions

Gillian,2016-11-06T21:09:00.000+02:00,november message from archangel michael,"its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install hillary clinton in the white house regardless of the true vote count 
via truthandaction 

it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look 


elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve
all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant
a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a clinton victory
a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a hillary clinton victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring hillary
political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with hillary clinton securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote
the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations
its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained
even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election
in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported
election fraud expert bev harris was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving
you need to have votes counted as fractions harris said on the alex jones show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden
vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes
theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it harris pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for hillary that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people

stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et

de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de

ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu

jeanbatave is a martial artist from the viking stronghold of normandy france he travels the world looking for new fighting techniques and new beautiful women eastern europe taught him everything he knows and is his second home his column runs every thursday november   news 
the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners 
i will let you be the own judge of the conclusions inspired by those images my father is a very cartesian fellow and a saying of his comes to mind 
just like saint thomas

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,Fake,putin condemns europes handling migrants says child rape austria shows dilution national values,posted november hillary courts black vote ethnomasochism reaches new low democratic presidential primary one unprecedented pandering nonwhite vote guardian summed one debates hillary clinton bernie sanders made conspicuous play latino african american voters mrs clinton conspicuous play hands nomination failure senator sanders win necessary quotient nonwhite votes repeatedly pointed chattering class time dropped february one black commenter pointedly wrote sen sanders many miles go convince black voters fight interests may black commenter steven thrasher wrote piece titled bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes fault mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem failing talk racism every turn accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered stage black lives matter activists several times comparison mrs clinton mr thrasher right sen sanders mainstream candidate history united states thoroughly debased quest black vote mrs clinton since helped win democratic nomination continued strategy days remaining november th lets take look hillary clintons ethnomasochistic moments january mrs clinton something called iowa brown black forum none jorge ramos asked tell us term white privilege means give example life career think benefitted began answer start think hard swimming ocean know exactly happening around much youre standing shore perhaps watching born white middleclass middle america early democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released memo aimed stifling rising momentum bernie sanders whereas electorates iowa new hampshire largely ruralsuburban predominantly white march primary states better reflect true diversity democratic party nation difficult impossible democrat win nomination without strong levels support among african american hispanic voters believe thats emphasis added shortly south carolina primary schomburg center research black culture harlem mrs clinton explained break barriers african americans ending systemic racism requires contributions usespecially us havent experienced white americans need better job listening african americans talk seen unseen barriers face every day need recognize privilege practice humility rather assume experiences everyones experiences us need bring skills bearand especially young people coming today passion social justice helping create new ways solve intractable problems april back radio show mrs clinton asked always carries bag immediately answered hot sauce one black hosts noted would accused pandering black people giving answer asked hopeully working weeks black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers democratic national convention convened nominate mrs clinton passed resolution doubt approval supporting black lives matter dnc joins americans across country affirming black lives matter say name efforts make visible pain fellow sister americans condemn extrajudicial killings unarmed african american men women children white politicians tried win elections public displays ethnomasochism decades election set new low mrs clinton loses pandering could live another form black lives matter activist tef poe explained mr trump wins young niggas fully hell bent inciting riots everywhere go aint rules weve nice,1
