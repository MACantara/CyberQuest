it was a standard day in the life of donald trumps presidential campaign as the republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail thursday making outrageous and insulting comments 
this was on clear display at a rally in toledo ohio when trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet cancel the election and just anoint him president 
video trump jokes we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right what are we even having it for her policies are so bad pictwittercomstzidbpf 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
im just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right trump asked the crowd what are we even having it for  her policies are so bad 
despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities 
video help me out there did trump just say were going to work on our ghettos before mentioning inner cities violence and african americans pictwittercomvkqzslbh 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
trumps comments 
were gonna work on our ghettos  take a look at whats going on where you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems so many horrible horrible problems  the violence the death the lack of education no jobs were gonna work with the africanamerican community and were going to solve the problem of the inner city  you cant walk out the street you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot 
the republican nominees ghetto comment is the newest addition to what is the standard trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes this particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited north carolina for a rally and told supporters  mostly white  that he would enact a new deal for black america

today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left 
the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate

wednesday november   by j d heyes tags food poverty  hunger  obama administration naturalnews a democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another democratic president barack obama she is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them and yet by any true measure the economy has been a disaster under obama real growth has nearly flatlined  real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration  and  million americans cannot get enough food without government assistancein fact on that last point and as reported by natural blaze  in the obama economy in americans are going to bed hungry on most nights if not every nightand clinton wants to double down on obamas economic policies how can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry americans for the past eight years americans have had to listen to lectures from obama and other democrats about how we as a firstworld nation should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and increasingly to noncitizens  but shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooof course but malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the us thats because in real terms workers wages are falling and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tablesfor many particularly the low paid sic this means two things fuel and food poverty  natural blaze reportedlow salaries combined with stagnant wages jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury and of those who can still afford food many have to settle for cheap nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches carbohydrates and calories now winter approaches and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil which traditionally produce higher pricesbut the establishment media is part of the problem for example in february bloomberg reported that in americans were on food stamps despite an economic recovery  no one should ever be hungry in america unless they choose to be what recovery obamas economy is growing at about  percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing themso the caveat is disingenuous a more accurate story would have reflected on the in figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among americans to find better employment opportunities in fact the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a in ratio is no big deal or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people which is itits the latter of course and while america will always have a portion of the population that is too sick too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the treasury  the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth in todays america that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry but is actually causing them to go hungryand that should never happen
