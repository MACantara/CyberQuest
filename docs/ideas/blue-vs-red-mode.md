# Blue Team vs Red Team (Player vs AI) Mode Ideas

## Overview
A competitive and educational mode where the player (Blue Team) defends a simulated environment against an AI-driven attacker (Red Team). The goal is to teach both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills in a dynamic, replayable scenario.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Blue Team (Player):** Defends systems, detects intrusions, responds to incidents, patches vulnerabilities, and maintains uptime.
- **Red Team (AI):** Attempts to breach, exploit, and disrupt the environment using a variety of attack vectors and adaptive strategies.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Each session is unique, with randomized attack patterns, system configurations, and objectives.

---

## Gameplay Flow
1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - Player reviews network topology, asset inventory, and current threat intelligence.
   - Can deploy initial defenses (firewalls, IDS/IPS, patching, user training, etc.).
2. **Attack Phase:**
   - AI Red Team launches attacks (phishing, malware, brute force, lateral movement, etc.).
   - Player receives alerts, investigates incidents, and responds in real time.
3. **Response & Recovery:**
   - Player must contain breaches, eradicate threats, and restore affected systems.
   - Post-incident analysis and reporting.
4. **Scoring & Feedback:**
   - Points awarded for detection speed, response effectiveness, system uptime, and successful defense.
   - Bonus for identifying attack patterns and root causes.

## Blue Team (Player) Actions
- Monitor logs and alerts
- Investigate suspicious activity
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Configure and tune security controls
- Quarantine infected hosts
- Communicate with simulated users/management
- Run forensics and root cause analysis

## Red Team (AI) Behaviors
- Reconnaissance (network scanning, OSINT)
- Social engineering (phishing, pretexting)
- Exploitation (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations)
- Persistence (backdoors, scheduled tasks)
- Lateral movement (credential reuse, pivoting)
- Data exfiltration and disruption
- Adaptive tactics based on Blue Team actions

---

## Features & Mechanics
- **Randomized Scenarios:** Different attack chains and system weaknesses each playthrough
- **Difficulty Levels:** AI adapts to player skill and chosen difficulty
- **Replayability:** New threats, tools, and objectives each session
- **Leaderboard:** Track top defenders and fastest response times
- **Co-op/Competitive:** Potential for future player-vs-player or team-vs-team expansion

---

## Educational Value
- Teaches both offensive and defensive mindsets
- Reinforces incident response, threat hunting, and security best practices
- Provides instant feedback and post-game analysis

---

## Potential Expansions
- Add real-world threat intelligence feeds
- Integrate with existing levels for campaign mode
- Allow custom scenario creation
- Support for multiplayer (Blue vs Blue, Red vs Red)

---

## Example Scenario
> The player is notified of unusual outbound traffic. The AI Red Team has compromised a workstation via phishing and is attempting lateral movement. The player must:
> - Identify the initial compromise
> - Contain the infected host
> - Trace the attack path
> - Patch the exploited vulnerability
> - Report on the incident

---

## Notes
- This mode is not a single level, but a replayable, evolving simulation.
- Focus is on skill-building, adaptability, and real-world relevance.
