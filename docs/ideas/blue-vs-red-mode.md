# Blue Team vs Red Team (Player vs AI) Mode Ideas

## Overview
A competitive and educational mode where the player (Blue Team) defends a simulated environment against an AI-driven attacker (Red Team). The goal is to teach both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills in a dynamic, replayable scenario.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Blue Team (Player):** Defends systems, detects intrusions, responds to incidents, patches vulnerabilities, and maintains uptime.
- **Red Team (AI):** Attempts to breach, exploit, and disrupt the environment using a variety of attack vectors and adaptive strategies.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Each session is unique, with randomized attack patterns, system configurations, and objectives.

---

## Gameplay Flow
1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - Player reviews network topology, asset inventory, and current threat intelligence.
   - Can deploy initial defenses (firewalls, IDS/IPS, patching, user training, etc.).
2. **Attack Phase:**
   - AI Red Team launches attacks (phishing, malware, brute force, lateral movement, etc.).
   - Player receives alerts, investigates incidents, and responds in real time.
3. **Response & Recovery:**
   - Player must contain breaches, eradicate threats, and restore affected systems.
   - Post-incident analysis and reporting.
4. **Scoring & Feedback:**
   - Points awarded for detection speed, response effectiveness, system uptime, and successful defense.
   - Bonus for identifying attack patterns and root causes.

---

## Blue Team (Player) Actions
- Monitor logs and alerts
- Investigate suspicious activity
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Configure and tune security controls
- Quarantine infected hosts
- Communicate with simulated users/management
- Run forensics and root cause analysis

## Red Team (AI) Behaviors
- Reconnaissance (network scanning, OSINT)
- Social engineering (phishing, pretexting)
- Exploitation (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations)
- Persistence (backdoors, scheduled tasks)
- Lateral movement (credential reuse, pivoting)
- Data exfiltration and disruption
- Adaptive tactics based on Blue Team actions

---

## Features & Mechanics
- **Randomized Scenarios:** Different attack chains and system weaknesses each playthrough
- **Difficulty Levels:** AI adapts to player skill and chosen difficulty
- **Replayability:** New threats, tools, and objectives each session
- **Leaderboard:** Track top defenders and fastest response times
- **Co-op/Competitive:** Potential for future player-vs-player or team-vs-team expansion

---

## Educational Value
- Teaches both offensive and defensive mindsets
- Reinforces incident response, threat hunting, and security best practices
- Provides instant feedback and post-game analysis

---

## Potential Expansions
- Add real-world threat intelligence feeds
- Integrate with existing levels for campaign mode
- Allow custom scenario creation
- Support for multiplayer (Blue vs Blue, Red vs Red)

---

## Example Scenario
> The player is notified of unusual outbound traffic. The AI Red Team has compromised a workstation via phishing and is attempting lateral movement. The player must:
> - Identify the initial compromise
> - Contain the infected host
> - Trace the attack path
> - Patch the exploited vulnerability
> - Report on the incident

## Interface Design Direction

Based on the unique needs of the Blue Team vs Red Team mode, the interface will evolve beyond the current simulated PC. The new interface will:

- **Draw inspiration from the simulated PC** for visual style and user experience, maintaining familiarity for returning players.
- **Expand to include network-wide and strategic views**—such as dashboards, network topology maps, real-time alert feeds, and asset management panels.
- **Support multi-host and incident response workflows** with intuitive navigation between systems, alerts, and response tools.
- **Enable future scalability** for co-op/team play, scenario customization, and advanced Blue Team features.

**Rationale:**
- The new interface will better support the mode’s focus on dynamic, multi-layered defense, incident response, and strategic decision-making.
- It will provide a modern Blue Team simulation experience while preserving the immersive, hands-on feel and conceptual strengths of the original PC interface, even if not directly embedded.

This approach ensures both depth and accessibility, aligning with the educational and gameplay goals of the mode.

## Red Team AI Algorithm Outline

The Red Team AI is designed to simulate a realistic, adaptive attacker using a multi-phase approach. The algorithm will combine rule-based logic, weighted randomness, and state-driven decision-making to create dynamic, replayable challenges.

### 1. Attack Phases
The AI operates in distinct phases, each with specific goals and available actions:
- **Reconnaissance:** Scan network, gather OSINT, enumerate assets and vulnerabilities.
- **Initial Access:** Attempt phishing, exploit public-facing services, or use brute force.
- **Establish Foothold:** Deploy persistence mechanisms (backdoors, scheduled tasks).
- **Lateral Movement:** Identify and exploit trust relationships, move to other hosts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Seek higher privileges via exploits or credential theft.
- **Action on Objectives:** Exfiltrate data, disrupt services, or achieve scenario-specific goals.
- **Cover Tracks:** Clear logs, remove tools, and evade detection.

### 2. Decision-Making Logic
- **State Machine:** The AI maintains an internal state (e.g., current access, discovered assets, detected defenses) and transitions between phases based on success, failure, or Blue Team actions.
- **Weighted Randomness:** Within each phase, the AI selects actions based on weighted probabilities, which can be influenced by scenario difficulty and Blue Team behavior.
- **Adaptive Response:** The AI monitors Blue Team actions (e.g., patching, quarantining, alerting) and adapts tactics—switching attack vectors, increasing stealth, or accelerating attacks if detection is likely.
- **Goal-Oriented Planning:** The AI prioritizes actions that bring it closer to its objectives, using a simple planning algorithm (e.g., A* or rule-based prioritization).

### 3. Learning, Replayability, and Advanced AI
- **Scenario Randomization:** Each session, the AI randomizes its initial knowledge, available exploits, and attack chains.
- **Behavioral Variation:** The AI can select from different attacker "personalities" (e.g., stealthy, aggressive, opportunistic) to keep gameplay fresh.
- **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning, DQN):** For advanced versions, the AI can leverage reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn optimal attack strategies over many simulated playthroughs, adapting to Blue Team defenses and maximizing its objectives.
- **NLP Integration:** Natural Language Processing can be used to generate or interpret phishing emails, social engineering messages, or to analyze Blue Team communications/logs for more realistic and adaptive attacks.
- **Initial Implementation:** The first version will focus on deterministic and probabilistic logic, with RL and NLP as future enhancements for greater realism and challenge.

### 4. Example Pseudocode
```python
class RedTeamAI:
    def __init__(self, scenario):
        self.state = 'reconnaissance'
        self.known_assets = []
        self.access = set()
        self.objectives = scenario.objectives
        # ...other state variables...

    def decide_next_action(self, blue_team_actions):
        if self.state == 'reconnaissance':
            # Weighted choice: scan, OSINT, enumerate
            # Transition to 'initial_access' if enough info
            pass
        elif self.state == 'initial_access':
            # Try phishing, exploit, brute force
            # On success, move to 'establish_foothold'
            pass
        # ...other phases...
        # Adapt based on blue_team_actions
```
