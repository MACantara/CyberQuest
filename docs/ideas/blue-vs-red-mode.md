# Blue Team vs Red Team (Player vs AI) Mode Ideas

## Overview
A competitive and educational mode where the player (Blue Team) defends a simulated environment against an AI-driven attacker (Red Team). The goal is to teach both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills in a dynamic, replayable scenario.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Blue Team (Player):** Defends systems, detects intrusions, responds to incidents, patches vulnerabilities, and maintains uptime.
- **Red Team (AI):** Attempts to breach, exploit, and disrupt the environment using a variety of attack vectors and adaptive strategies.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Each session is unique, with randomized attack patterns, system configurations, and objectives.

---

## Gameplay Flow
1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - Player reviews network topology, asset inventory, and current threat intelligence.
   - Can deploy initial defenses (firewalls, IDS/IPS, patching, user training, etc.).
2. **Attack Phase:**
   - AI Red Team launches attacks (phishing, malware, brute force, lateral movement, etc.).
   - Player receives alerts, investigates incidents, and responds in real time.
3. **Response & Recovery:**
   - Player must contain breaches, eradicate threats, and restore affected systems.
   - Post-incident analysis and reporting.
4. **Scoring & Feedback:**
   - Points awarded for detection speed, response effectiveness, system uptime, and successful defense.
   - Bonus for identifying attack patterns and root causes.

## Blue Team (Player) Actions
- Monitor logs and alerts
- Investigate suspicious activity
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Configure and tune security controls
- Quarantine infected hosts
- Communicate with simulated users/management
- Run forensics and root cause analysis

## Red Team (AI) Behaviors
- Reconnaissance (network scanning, OSINT)
- Social engineering (phishing, pretexting)
- Exploitation (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations)
- Persistence (backdoors, scheduled tasks)
- Lateral movement (credential reuse, pivoting)
- Data exfiltration and disruption
- Adaptive tactics based on Blue Team actions

---

## Features & Mechanics
- **Randomized Scenarios:** Different attack chains and system weaknesses each playthrough
- **Difficulty Levels:** AI adapts to player skill and chosen difficulty
- **Replayability:** New threats, tools, and objectives each session
- **Leaderboard:** Track top defenders and fastest response times
- **Co-op/Competitive:** Potential for future player-vs-player or team-vs-team expansion

---

## Educational Value
- Teaches both offensive and defensive mindsets
- Reinforces incident response, threat hunting, and security best practices
- Provides instant feedback and post-game analysis

---

## Potential Expansions
- Add real-world threat intelligence feeds
- Integrate with existing levels for campaign mode
- Allow custom scenario creation
- Support for multiplayer (Blue vs Blue, Red vs Red)

---

## Example Scenario
> The player is notified of unusual outbound traffic. The AI Red Team has compromised a workstation via phishing and is attempting lateral movement. The player must:
> - Identify the initial compromise
> - Contain the infected host
> - Trace the attack path
> - Patch the exploited vulnerability
> - Report on the incident

## Interface Design Direction

Based on the unique needs of the Blue Team vs Red Team mode, the interface will evolve beyond the current simulated PC. The new interface will:

- **Draw inspiration from the simulated PC** for visual style and user experience, maintaining familiarity for returning players.
- **Expand to include network-wide and strategic views**—such as dashboards, network topology maps, real-time alert feeds, and asset management panels.
- **Support multi-host and incident response workflows** with intuitive navigation between systems, alerts, and response tools.
- **Enable future scalability** for co-op/team play, scenario customization, and advanced Blue Team features.

**Rationale:**
- The new interface will better support the mode’s focus on dynamic, multi-layered defense, incident response, and strategic decision-making.
- It will provide a modern Blue Team simulation experience while preserving the immersive, hands-on feel and conceptual strengths of the original PC interface, even if not directly embedded.

This approach ensures both depth and accessibility, aligning with the educational and gameplay goals of the mode.

---
## Notes
- This mode is not a single level, but a replayable, evolving simulation.
- Focus is on skill-building, adaptability, and real-world relevance.
