# Player Data Analytics Ideas

## ðŸ“Š 1. General Usage Statistics
*These track how often and how long users engage with your platform.*

- **Session length** â€“ Time spent per session or module.  
- **Time-on-task** â€“ Time spent on specific challenges or learning objectives.  
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)** â€“ Number of unique users who engage with the platform each day.
- **Weekly Active Users (WAU)** â€“ Number of unique users who engage with the platform each week.
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)** â€“ Number of unique users who engage with the platform each month.
- **DAU/MAU ratio** â€“ DAU divided by MAU to understand daily engagement.  
- **Retention rate** â€“ Percentage of players who return after first use (e.g., Day 1, Day 7, Day 30).  
- **Session frequency** â€“ How often an average user starts a session in a given time window (e.g., sessions per user per week).
- **Drop-off rate** â€“ Where users quit the game or training (useful for funnel analysis).  
- **Churn rate** â€“ Percentage of users who stop using the platform over a defined period (inverse indicator to retention).
- **Completion rate** â€“ Percent of users who finish modules, levels, or the entire course.  

### Short calculation formulas (compact):

- **DAU** = count(unique users active on a given day)
- **WAU** = count(unique users active in the last 7 days)
- **MAU** = count(unique users active in the last 30 days)
- **DAU/MAU ratio** = DAU / MAU
- **Average session length** = total_session_time_seconds / total_sessions
- **Session frequency** = total_sessions / unique_users (for the chosen time window)
- **Retention rate (Day N)** = (users_active_on_day_N / users_in_cohort) * 100%
- **Churn rate** = ((users_at_period_start - users_at_period_end) / users_at_period_start) * 100%
- **Average interactions per user** = total_actions (clicks/choices/hints/messages) / unique_users
- **Average rating** = sum(all_ratings) / count(all_ratings)
- **NPS** = %promoters (9-10) - %detractors (0-6)

## ðŸŽ® 2. Gameplay Interaction
*Understand how users interact with the simulation mechanics and challenges.*

- **Levels completed** â€“ Number and percentage of levels/challenges completed.  
- **Actions per session** â€“ Number of meaningful actions taken per play session.  
- **Hint usage** â€“ How often users request help or hints.  
- **Time to completion** â€“ Average time taken to complete a level or scenario.  
- **Failure rate / Retry attempts** â€“ How often users fail and retry specific challenges.  
- **Choices made** â€“ Decisions taken in branching narratives or scenarios (useful for adaptive learning paths).  
- **Achievements/unlocks** â€“ Gamified rewards achieved (badges, points, items).

## ðŸ’¡ 3. Engagement Quality Metrics (Subjective/Behavioral)
*Optional but useful for qualitative analysis.*

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** â€“ Willingness to recommend the training to others.  
- **User feedback & rating** â€“ Star/score ratings and qualitative comments collected after sessions or modules; tracked over time for trend analysis.

---

## ðŸ“¥ 4. Backend & Technical Analytics
*For monitoring the health of the simulation itself and device-level data.*

- **Load times & errors** â€“ How system performance affects engagement.  
- **Device/browser usage** â€“ Optimizing UX for most-used platforms.  
- **Click paths** â€“ Sequence of user interactions for UX flow analysis.
