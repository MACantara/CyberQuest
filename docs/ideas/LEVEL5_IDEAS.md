## üïµÔ∏è The Investigation Story

### The Null's Background
**Previous Level Connections**:
- **Level 1**: Bot network IP addresses found in misinformation campaign
- **Level 2**: Phishing email headers contain unique sender signatures  
- **Level 3**: Malware samples have identical code patterns
- **Level 4**: Vulnerability exploitation shows consistent techniques

**The Null's Profile**:
- **Primary Alias**: The Null (uses "N4LL" in code comments)
- **Signature**: Leaves Base64 encoded messages as calling cards
- **Pattern**: Attacks every Tuesday at 2:00 AM EST
- **Goal**: Student must connect evidence across all previous incidents

### Investigation Phases (MVP)
1. **Evidence Collection** - Find files, logs, and artifacts
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify The Null's behavioral patterns  
3. **Timeline Building** - Arrange events in chronological order
4. **Final Analysis** - Present findings and expose The Null's identity

## üîç Core Forensics Activities (MVP)

### File Manager Investigation
**Evidence Discovery Tasks**:
- **Hidden Files**: Find files with "null" in the name using search
- **Deleted Files**: Recover files from "Recycle Bin" or "Trash"
- **File Analysis**: Examine file properties (creation date, size, type)
- **Directory Patterns**: Notice The Null organizes files in specific folder structures

**Key Evidence Files**:
```
/evidence/level1_bot_logs.txt        (IP: 192.168.1.100 - recurring)
/evidence/level2_email_headers.txt   (X-Mailer: NullSender v1.0)
/evidence/level3_malware_sample.exe  (Code comment: "// N4LL was here")
/evidence/level4_exploit_code.py     (Function name: null_exploit())
/evidence/hidden_message.txt         (Base64: VGhlTnVsbElzSGVyZQ==)
```

### Terminal Forensics Commands (Simplified)
```bash
# Basic commands students learn
find . -name "*null*"                    # Find files with "null" in name
grep -r "N4LL" /var/log/                 # Search for signature in logs
ls -la                                   # Show hidden files and timestamps
cat suspicious_file.txt                  # Read file contents
strings malware.exe | grep password      # Extract readable text from binary
```

### System Logs Analysis
**Log Investigation Tasks**:
- **Login Patterns**: Find repeated login attempts from same IP
- **Timestamp Correlation**: Notice all attacks happen at 2:00 AM Tuesday
- **Failed Attempts**: Identify unsuccessful login attempts before successful ones
- **Process Analysis**: Find processes with suspicious names

**Sample Log Entries**:
```
2024-08-05 02:00:15 - Failed login: user "admin" from 192.168.1.100
2024-08-05 02:00:32 - Successful login: user "admin" from 192.168.1.100  
2024-08-05 02:15:45 - Process started: "definitely_not_malware.exe"
2024-08-05 02:30:12 - File deleted: "/tmp/evidence_cleanup.sh"
```

## üß© Evidence Correlation (MVP)

### Pattern Recognition Challenges
**Students Must Identify**:
1. **IP Address**: 192.168.1.100 appears in all incident logs
2. **Timing Pattern**: All attacks occur Tuesday 2:00 AM EST
3. **Signature**: "N4LL" appears in code comments and log entries
4. **Tool Preference**: Always uses "NullSender" for email attacks
5. **Cleanup Behavior**: Attempts to delete evidence after each attack

### Simple Timeline Building
**Interactive Timeline Exercise**:
```
Week 1: Level 1 Incident (Misinformation bots deployed)
Week 2: Level 2 Incident (Phishing campaign launched)  
Week 3: Level 3 Incident (Malware distributed)
Week 4: Level 4 Incident (Vulnerability exploited)
Week 5: Current Investigation (Find The Null)
```

### Basic Attribution
**Evidence Correlation Exercise**:
- Match IP addresses across different incident reports
- Connect timestamps to establish attack schedule
- Link code signatures to prove same attacker
- Identify tools used consistently across incidents

- **File Recovery**: Restore deleted files from trash/recycle bin

### Terminal Activities  
- **Basic Commands**: Learn 5-6 essential forensics commands
- **Log Analysis**: Use grep to search for patterns in log files
- **File Examination**: Use strings, cat, and ls commands
- **Evidence Documentation**: Create investigation notes using echo and redirection

### System Logs Review
- **Login Analysis**: Identify unusual login patterns and failed attempts
- **Process Monitoring**: Find suspicious processes and their execution times
- **Network Activity**: Review basic network connection logs
- **Event Correlation**: Connect events across different log files

## üéØ The Final Revelation (Simplified)

### Investigation Outcomes
**Based on Evidence Found (70%+ required to pass)**:

**Success (70-100% evidence)**: 
- **Identity Revealed**: The Null is actually "Alex Thompson", former IT intern
- **Motive**: Seeking revenge after being fired for poor performance
- **Method**: Using knowledge from internship to access systems
- **Resolution**: Evidence forwarded to authorities for prosecution

**Partial Success (50-69% evidence)**:
- **Pattern Identified**: Recognize attack signatures and timing
- **Prevention**: Can detect future attacks by same actor  
- **Learning**: Understand what evidence was missed

**Insufficient Evidence (<50%)**:
- **Case Review**: Detailed feedback on missed clues
- **Second Chance**: Option to re-examine evidence with hints
- **Learning Focus**: Emphasis on systematic investigation methodology

### Simple Dialogue Options
**Final Confrontation with The Null**:
1. **"We have evidence linking you to all these attacks."**
2. **"Your attack pattern made you easy to track."**  
3. **"Why did you choose to become a cybercriminal?"**

**The Null's Response** (based on evidence quality):
- **High Evidence**: "I underestimated you. How did you find me?"
- **Medium Evidence**: "You got lucky, but you can't prove everything."
- **Low Evidence**: "You have nothing concrete. This won't stick."
