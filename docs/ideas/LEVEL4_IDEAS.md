## üîß Technical/Gameplay Phase: Penetration Testing

### Network Reconnaissance
- **Tool Simulation**: Use simulated `nmap` commands in terminal to discover network architecture
- **Service Discovery**: Map voting system components (web server, database, admin panels)
- **Port Analysis**: Identify open services on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL), 8080 (Admin Panel)
- **Interactive**: Click-to-scan different IP ranges and analyze results

### Web Application Security Testing
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Simulate OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite interface
- **SQL Injection Discovery**: Find injection point in voter lookup form
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Discover stored XSS in voting results page
- **Directory Traversal**: Uncover exposed config files through path manipulation
- **Broken Authentication**: Test default admin credentials (admin/password)

### Critical Vulnerability Chain
1. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** ‚Üí Access config files
2. **Configuration Exposure** ‚Üí Extract database credentials  
3. **Database Access** ‚Üí View/modify voting records
4. **Privilege Escalation** ‚Üí Admin panel access via JWT manipulation
5. **Vote Manipulation** ‚Üí Ability to alter election results

### Advanced Testing Scenarios
- **Logic Flaw**: Double-voting vulnerability through session manipulation
- **Access Control**: Bypass voter verification through cookie modification
- **Timing Attack**: Extract voter information through response time analysis
- **CSRF**: Cross-site request forgery allowing unauthorized vote submission

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Dilemma Scenarios

### 1. Cryptocurrency Bribe Attempt
**Trigger**: After documenting the vulnerability  
**Contact**: Anonymous "hacktivist" group via encrypted message  
**Offer**: 2 BTC (~$50,000) to publicly disclose vulnerability before patch

**Dialogue Tree Options**:
- **Report to Authorities** ‚Üí +100 Ethics XP, Law enforcement investigation
- **Ignore Message** ‚Üí +50 Ethics XP, Continue normal disclosure
- **Engage with Group** ‚Üí -200 Ethics XP, Potential legal consequences, alternate ending

### 2. Corporate Pressure Campaign
**Trigger**: SecureVote Inc. discovers you're the researcher  
**Contact**: CEO calls directly with settlement offer  
**Pressure**: $25,000 bonus + NDA to keep vulnerability private until "after election season"

**Options**:
- **Refuse and Continue Disclosure** ‚Üí +150 Ethics XP, Company may retaliate
- **Accept Settlement** ‚Üí -300 Ethics XP, Vulnerability remains unfixed
- **Negotiate Timeline** ‚Üí +75 Ethics XP, Compromise on 30-day disclosure

### 3. Live Election Crisis
**Trigger**: Vulnerability discovered during active municipal election  
**Dilemma**: Fix immediately (disrupting election) vs. wait (risk exploitation)  
**Media Pressure**: Local news investigating "voting irregularities"

**Choices**:
- **Emergency Disclosure** ‚Üí Immediate fix, potential vote invalidation
- **Wait Until Election Ends** ‚Üí Risk of exploitation, maintain democratic process
- **Anonymous Tip to Election Officials** ‚Üí Middle ground with moderate risk

### 4. Journalist Contact
**Trigger**: Tech journalist contacts you about "rumors of voting system flaws"  
**Pressure**: "The public has a right to know before the next election"  
**Stakes**: Article could trigger nationwide voting system reviews

**Response Options**:
- **Full Cooperation** ‚Üí Public disclosure, maximum transparency
- **Redacted Information** ‚Üí Limited disclosure protecting sensitive details  
- **No Comment** ‚Üí Maintain responsible disclosure timeline
- **Misleading Information** ‚Üí -500 Ethics XP, potentially dangerous

- **30-day Standard**: Balanced approach, industry standard
- **90-day Extended**: Maximum vendor flexibility, higher exploitation risk

### Legal Risk Assessment
**In-Game Legal Brief**:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) implications
- Good faith research protections
- Authorized vs. unauthorized testing boundaries
- Documentation requirements for legal safety -->
