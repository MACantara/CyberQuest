# CyberQuest - Supabase Migration

This document outlines the migration from SQLAlchemy/SQLite to Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the CyberQuest application.

## Migration Overview

The CyberQuest application has been migrated from using SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite to using Supabase as the database backend. This migration provides better scalability, reliability, and production readiness.

### What Changed

1. **Database Layer**: Replaced SQLAlchemy ORM with direct Supabase client calls
2. **Models**: Updated all model classes to use Supabase operations instead of SQLAlchemy
3. **Routes**: Modified all route handlers to use the new model methods
4. **Initialization**: Updated Flask app initialization to connect to Supabase

### Files Modified

#### Core Database Files
- `app/database.py` - New Supabase client configuration and utilities
- `app/__init__.py` - Updated Flask app initialization
- `requirements.txt` - Removed SQLAlchemy dependencies, kept supabase

#### Model Files
- `app/models/user.py` - Complete rewrite for Supabase
- `app/models/contact.py` - Updated for Supabase operations
- `app/models/login_attempt.py` - Migrated to Supabase
- `app/models/email_verification.py` - Updated for Supabase

#### Route Files
- `app/routes/auth.py` - Updated database operations
- `app/routes/contact.py` - Migrated to new Contact model
- `app/routes/profile.py` - Updated user operations
- `app/routes/admin.py` - Major updates for admin functionality
- `app/routes/login_attempts.py` - Updated for new LoginAttempt model
- `app/routes/email_verification.py` - Updated for new EmailVerification model

#### Database Schema
- `supabase_schema.sql` - Complete database schema for Supabase

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to the SQL editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Run the SQL script from `supabase_schema.sql` to create all required tables
4. Note your project URL and anon key from the project settings

### 2. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

## Database Schema

The Supabase database includes the following tables:

### users
- Primary user account information
- Includes username, email, password hash, admin status

### contact_submissions
- Contact form submissions from the website
- Includes name, email, subject, message, and read status

### login_attempts
- Security tracking for login attempts
- Includes IP address, success status, timestamps

### email_verifications
- Email verification tokens and status
- Links to users table for verification workflow

### password_reset_tokens
- Password reset tokens for account recovery
- Includes expiration and usage tracking

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication & Security
- Argon2 password hashing
- Login attempt tracking and IP lockout
- Email verification system
- Admin user management

### 2. Contact Management
- Contact form submissions
- Email notifications
- Admin dashboard for managing contacts

### 3. User Management
- User registration and profile management
- Admin panel for user administration
- Account activation/deactivation

### 4. Analytics Ready
- Player data analytics infrastructure
- Admin dashboard with statistics
- Blue team vs red team mode support

## Migration Benefits

1. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL handles concurrent users better than SQLite
2. **Reliability**: Supabase provides automatic backups and high availability
3. **Real-time**: Supabase supports real-time subscriptions (future enhancement)
4. **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
5. **Performance**: Better indexing and query optimization
6. **Production Ready**: No file-based database limitations

## Development Notes

### Error Handling
All database operations now use try-catch blocks with `DatabaseError` exceptions for consistent error handling.

### Pagination
Pagination is implemented using Supabase's `range()` method instead of SQLAlchemy's pagination.

### Relationships
Foreign key relationships are maintained in the database schema but handled manually in the application code.

### Transaction Management
Supabase handles transactions automatically for single operations. Complex operations may need manual transaction handling.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**: Verify SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY are correct
2. **Table Not Found**: Ensure the schema script was run successfully
3. **Permission Errors**: Check Row Level Security policies if enabled
4. **Performance**: Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to see Supabase operations:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('supabase').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Features**: Implement real-time notifications using Supabase subscriptions
2. **File Storage**: Use Supabase Storage for user uploads
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Leverage PostgreSQL's analytical capabilities
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Supabase Auth**: Consider migrating to Supabase Auth for enhanced security
