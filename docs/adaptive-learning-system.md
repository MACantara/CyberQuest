## Implementation Guide

### 1. Database Setup

```sql
-- Run the updated supabase_schema.sql to create adaptive learning tables
-- This extends your existing schema with new tables for adaptive learning
```

### 2. Backend Integration

The adaptive learning system integrates seamlessly with existing routes:

```python
# In your level completion handler
from app.utils.adaptive_learning_engine import AdaptiveLearningEngine

# Update user progress
AdaptiveLearningEngine.update_learning_path(user_id, level_id, performance_data)

# Get adaptive difficulty for next level
difficulty = AdaptiveLearningEngine.calculate_adaptive_difficulty(user_id, level_id)
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

**For Simulated PC Levels:**
```javascript
// Include adaptive learning scripts
<script src="/static/js/simulated-pc/adaptive-learning.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/simulated-pc/adaptive-integration.js"></script>

// The system automatically initializes and tracks user behavior
```

**For Blue Team vs Red Team Mode:**
```javascript
// Enhanced AI engine with adaptive features
const aiEngine = new AIEngine(gameController);
// System automatically adjusts difficulty and provides recommendations
```

### 4. User Preferences

Users can customize their learning experience through preferences:

```javascript
// Get/set user preferences
fetch('/api/adaptive/preferences', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        learning_style: 'visual',
        difficulty_preference: 'adaptive',
        hint_frequency: 'normal'
    })
